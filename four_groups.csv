No answer.


I do not feel like the cameras were out of range.  Cameras watched the first 
confrontation.  Cameras watched the banners.  Cmaeras watched the final 
confrontation with tanks.  Cameras watched the fire.  When weren't cameras 
able to watch?  When would cameras be unable to watch people coming out with 
their hands up?


Well, that is what BATF should have done.  Either, Koresh would have gone 
peaceably as he has done in the past, or perhaps it was already too close 
to the apocalypse in his own mind.  It is hard to predict the actions of 
a leader who would not release the children when most rational people would.

Now will you answer my question up top?

Let's see... April 15th... less than 30 at bats.... and you claim that he 
hasn't done too much so far!

Cut this guy some slack. Danny will produce this year. It's scary to think
just how much he'll produce if he were to stay healthy all year.

The Yanks have a lot going for them this year: good starting rotation, good
bullpen, good defense and a good lineup. Also, I like Buck Showalter. Frank
Howard on 1st is also a good move. Everything sounds good so far. 

If the Yanks stay healthy, they have a good chance at winning the pennant. This 
is the most fun I've had watching the Yanks since ""78!",sport

	Why are 'good' neighborhoods 'good' ? It isn't because every

	and (2) cooperation. In the 'good' neighborhoods, the residents
	make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when
	strangers are lurking around. 'Good' neighborhoods form groups
	like 'crime-watch' to increase this effect, and the relative
	effectiveness of the police. When hostiles are arrested, the
	good neighbors step up and say ""THAT'S the one officer ! He

"A few comments on the ATF's botched handling of this case:

1. Attempting to storm the compound in broad daylight?  The explanation
   we were given (at least at one point) was that they thought the cult
   members would be at religious services.  My only comment on this bit
   of idiocy is that if you're going to operate as a quasi-military unit,
   you'd better understand basic military tactics.  One cardinal rule
   is that only a fool plans an operation where if one assumption is
   incorrect, the operation will fail disastrously.

2. We were told that ATF got four agents killed because they were
   outgunned, they didn't expect such heavy resistance.  When
   questioned about why such an overwhelming military-style assault
   was planned, we were told that it was because the cultists were
   thought to be heavily armed.  Can you say contradictory?  I knew
   you could!

3. The BATF has had a bad reputation for years as a bunch of arrogant,
   hotdoggers.  I was talking to relatives a couple of weeks ago and
   referred to them as a bunch of Crockett and Tubbs wannabes.  I'm
   more than ever convinced that's right on target.  An anecdote not
   related to the Waco fiasco is that apparently the BATF screwed up
   some of the evidence in the World Trade Center bombing.  There's
   now an excellent chance some of the forensic evidence gathered by
   the FBI will not be admissible in court.  This is not hearsay.  I
   was told this by a relative of my wife's who happens to be an FBI
   agent.  His opinion of the BATF was, ummm, well, let's just say
   uncomplimentary.

4. I have *still* not been presented with one iota of evidence that
   the BD's had *any* of the alleged illegal weaponry which was the
   reason for the raid in the first place.  BTW, we're *still* hearing
   this justification.  AG Reno, on CNN yesterday, made references
   to this issue, without any substantiation.  She also waved around
   the ""He's a child abuser and we heard he was beating the children!""
   flag.  Sigh.

5. A point re the Feds in general: their handling of the whole siege
   reflected a complete lack of understanding of the probable thought
   processes of the cultists.  AG Reno said they pushed the button
   because they were afraid a mass suicide was in the offing.  My
   only comment on that is that if the cultists were that close to
   the edge, what the hell did she think their reaction would be to
   an hours-long assault on the compound where holes were punched in
   the walls and CS gas pumped in?  If I were a BD, I'd expect the
   forces of the godless government to assault me at any time.  In
   that light, whether they torched themselves or drank Jim Jones
   Kool-Aid is irrelevant.  Also, look at how the siege was conducted:
   Bright lights, loud rock music, cutting off communications and
   other contact with the outside.  All measures designed to make the
   BD's feel more and more isolated and threatened.  This might have
   been a great strategy - if they were dealing with criminals.  As it
   was, it looks to me like everything they did fed into Koresh's
   paranoid delusions.

I hate to pour cold water on this, but currently seawater extracted
uranium, even using the new, improved fiber absorbers from Japan, is
about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market.
Uranium is *very* cheap right now, around $10/lb.  Right now, there
are mines closing because they can't compete with places like Cigar
Lake in Canada (where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards
to the mines, who work in shielded vehicles).  Plenty of other sources
(for example, uranium from phosphate processing) would come on line before
uranium reached $200/lb.

""Demand and supply balance will collapse"" is nonsense.  Supply and
demand always balance; what changes is the price.  Is uranium going
to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century?
Not bloody likely.  New nuclear reactors are not being built

I will clarify my earlier quote.  God's laws were originally written for 
the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to
all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of
Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made
obsolete by Jesus.

If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the
following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon
the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.  If you'll notice, He
also reams into the Pharisees for mucking up the Law with their own contrived
interpretations.  They knew every letter of the Law and followed it with their
heads but not their hearts.  That is why He points out that our righteousness
must surpass that of the Pharisees in order to be accepted into the kingdom
of Heaven.  People such as the Pharisees are those who really go out of their
way to debate about the number of angels that can dance on the head of a pin.
They had become legalistic, rule-makers - religious lawyers who practiced the
letter of the Law but never really believed in it.  

I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of
modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe
in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?

Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's
perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.
Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is their
choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.

  That brings up an interesting point. Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about
prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of
Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked 
at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they
were 24, and noticed some interesting things. 

  For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in
the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the
majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that
they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers
lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also  
found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and
produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first
group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away
the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc. 

  It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory.

"SSF is up for redesign again.  Let's do it right this
time!  Let's step back and consider the functionality we want:

[1] microgravity/vacuum process research
[2] life sciences research (adaptation to space)
[3] spacecraft maintenence 

The old NASA approach, explified by Shuttle and SSF so far, was to
centralize functionality.  These projects failed to meet
their targets by a wide margin: the military and commercial users 
took most of their payloads off Shuttle after wasting much effort to 
tie their payloads to it, and SSF has crumbled into disorganization
and miscommunication.  Over $50 billion has been spent on these
two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement
in commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial 
users have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the 
constellation.  

Firstly, different functions are broken down into different 
constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function:
thus we have the GPS/Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbits,
comsats in Clarke and Molniya orbits, etc.  Secondly, the task
is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,
providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed.

SSF's 3 main functions require quite different environments
and are also prime candidates for constellization.

[1] We have the makings of a microgravity constellation now:
COMET and Mir for long-duration flights, Shuttle/Spacelab for
short-duration flights.  The best strategy for this area is
inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.S. facilities 
on Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab
to a much less expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.
We might also expand the research program to take advantage of 
interesting space environments, eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt 
or gas/plasma gradients in comet tails.  The COMET system can
be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks, where a 
station is too large to affordably launch beyond LEO.

[2] We need to study life sciences not just in microgravity,
but also in lunar and Martian gravities, and in the radiation
environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter
of LEO.  This is a very long-term, low-priority project, since
astronauts will have little practical use in the space program
until costs come down orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, using
astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation,
and the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation
tether-bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity
in super-Van-Allen-Belt orbits that are representative of the
radiation environment encountered on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mars,
Earth-asteroid, etc. trips.  The miniaturized life support
machinery might be operated real-time from earth thru a VR
interface.  AFter several orbital missions have been flown,
follow-ons can act as LDEFs on the lunar and Martian surface,
testing out the actual environment at low cost before $billions
are spent on astronauts.

[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in 
Clarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperated
robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can
practice their skills.  Once in place, robots can pry stuck
solar arrays and antennas, attach solar battery power packs,
inject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet is working, it can be
spun off to commercial company(s) who can work with the comsat
companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards.

By applying the successful constellation strategy, and getting
rid of the failed centralized strategy of STS and old SSF, we
have radically improved the capability of the program while
greatly cutting its cost.  For a fraction of SSF's pricetag,
we can fix satellites where the satellites are, we can study
life's adaptation to a much large & more representative variety 
of space environments, and we can do microgravity and vacuum
research inexpensively and, if needed, in special-purpose
orbits.

N.B., we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration
as well, greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality.  
Mars Network and Artemis are two good examples of this; more ambitiously 
we can set up a network of native propellant plants on Mars that can be used
to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospecting and
sample return.  The descendants of LabRatSat's technology can
be used as a Mars surface LDEF and to test out closed-ecology
greenhouses on Mars at low cost.

I suppose that depends on how you define 'vast' majority....

You are correct about 'majority.'  Somewhere between 1 out of three and 
one out of 10 will at some period in their lives experience a violent 
assault.  The risk is generally higher than emergency medical problems
like heart attack and stroke.

'Vast' is probably too loose a term.  With approximately 1,000,000 Americans
using firearms each year, over a 30 year period we get (roughly, since some
may have to do this more than once) 30 MILLION Americans with experience in 
using firearms for self defense.  30/250 yields 12 percent of the population.
(Yes, I know that is a REAL rough estimate.  We're closer to 270 million now, 
but many of these are minors and should be included etc, thus the percentage
if anything is low.)

At any rate, most minority groups in this range are not usually referred 
to as 'tiny' minorities, so I don't see how the other part of the group 
can be referred to as the 'vast' majority.  A little more work might 
support a 'simple' majority of Americans never use, own or display a firearm.

Certainly when you are talking about OWNERSHIP you are wrong.  Nearly half
of your fellow citizens own one or more firearms.

I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even
contributed a few comments) but this stuff ""I'd rather face a knife than
a gun"" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the
same thing, then I got 'educated.'

People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how
quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that
it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick
(within a minute or so) death.

The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage
points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are
'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly
only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a
remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a
spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.

Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by
accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for
a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only
moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a
DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out
of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and
ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and
strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks
used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled
slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained
martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up
against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as
the attacker.

Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing
with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a
knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their
knife attacks in prison.

If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize
these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is
the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced
attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old
man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about
one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking
cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike
in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3
seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons
that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest
with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the
pointed end.)

Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth.
Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that
destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve
seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'

This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman
in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That
lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All
four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta
girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex
of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and
destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball
sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was
out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight
months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was
on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think
civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.

The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife
attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good
alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk
(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor
them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact
weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and
is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a
caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually
do this.

Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live
and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason
'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep
us alive.

I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now
know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would
have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I
WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not
fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen
behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do
whatever it takes.",politics

[]       And as far as fully-automatic weapons, you can be a lot better
[]armed if you want to hit what you aim at.
[]

Define ""armed better"". Go shoot a revolver and a semi-auto like the
Colt .45. Does one fires faster than the other? Nope. Aside from which
faster rate of fire is usually not desirable. Sure it makes the other
guys duck for cover, but just *YOU* trying hitting anything with a Thompson
in hose-mode. This is why the military is limiting it's M-16 now to
3-round burst-fire. Simple semi-auto would be better, but the troops
like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo (something
often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful).

A revolver is equally capable as a semi-auto in the same caliber.

- A revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull
  the trigger again.
- A double-action revolver (almost all of them) can be hand-cocked first,
  but will fire merely by pulling the trigger.
- A misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again
  to rotate to the next round.
- A revolver can be carried with the 6th chamber empty and under the
  hammer for maximum safety, but still can be drawn and fired with an
  easy motion, even one handed.
- Speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines
  on semi-autos. Can be faster depending on users.

- A misfire in a semi-auto will require you to clear a jammed shell
  first, time spent which can be fatal. And a vital second or so is often
  lost as you realize ""hey, it's jammed!"" before starting to do anything
  about clearing it.
- Most semi-autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round
  and cock the hammer. Some police carry their semi-autos with the 
  chamber loaded and hammer cocked, but a safety engaged. I do not consider
  this safe however. You must trade-off safety to get the same speed
  of employment as a revolver.
- There are some double-action semi-autos out there, but the complexity of
  operation of many of them requires more training.

Some police departments switched to Glocks, and then started quietly
switching many officers back to the old revolvers. Too many were having
accidents, partly due to the poor training they received. Not that Glocks
require rocket scientists, but some cops are baffled by something as complex
as the timer on a VCR.

Anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun
the police don't know nothing about firearms. Turn off COPS and Hunter
and pay attention. I do not seek here to say ""semi-autos are junk""
merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid. A cop
with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than
equipped for anything short of a riot.

Gun control is hitting what you aim at. If you whip out a 
wonder-nine and fire real fast you may find you don't hit anything.
Good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit.
I own a 9mm Beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon
to something like the Ruger Security Six revolver. If I haven't hit
what I'm aiming at in the first 5 shots, something is quite seriously
wrong somewheres. While I might like having the backup capacity of those
extra shots in certain cases, overwhelmingly the # of shots fired in
criminal encounters is less than 5.

What do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime? Why the same nice simple
.38 revolvers that the police often use. Well actually some police 
prefer the much heftier .357 Magnum, but anyway.....

ObPlea: Don't flame me, I prefer semi-autos for most things. But they 
        introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve-wracking
        as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal.

This comparison doesn't measure the costs of self-defense and it
doesn't measure the benefits either.  For example, the goal is not to
kill the attacker, whatever your relationship to him, but to stop him.
While the number of killings may be proportional to the number of
stops, it isn't equal.

   Firearms tend to fall into this low dollar/pound area.  It would not
   be economic to smuggle them in.  All production would have to be
   local.  There are not all that many people who have both the skill
   AND motivation to assemble worthwhile firearms from scratch.
   High-ranking crime figures could obtain imported Uzis and such, but
   the average person, and average thug, would be lucky to get a zip-gun
   - and would pay through the nose for it.

Good point you make.  However, a zip gun, by definition, is a crude,
homemade gun--certainly not something capable of sustained, accurate
fire, but it would be useful as a means of getting a normal gun.  Recall
the tiny, single-shot pistols made by the Allies during World War II for
use by partisans.  They were essentially well-made zipguns, incapable of
effective fire beyond a few feet.  But they were useful as a means of
killing German soldiers for their guns.

Also note that the crowd-pleasin' favorite, the Sten gun, was
specifically designed to require as little machine work as possible.
The point's been made here that one could make a Sten clone with steel
tubing, hand tools and a welder.

I still think that while the point is good, I think there's a difference
between marijuana and firearms, in that quality marijuana can be grown
locally; there's no need to import the stuff.  If guns are banned, I
think the demand for ""real"" guns will be sufficient to make smuggling
economically feasible, thus rendering a ban moot.  In any case, the
result would be the same--people who aren't criminals won't have
firearms, and ""bad guys"" will continue to have access to them, one way
or another.  And I don't see that as a necessary situation.",politics

And who is responsible for it not happening?
Certainly not the children.  Koresh was calling the shots.  He was 
talking with his lawyer and the FBI.  Since others were released safely, 
there is no sane reason for keeping the children inside the compound.


Not at all.  Are you a Koresh worshiper?


Thanks for my laugh of the day!  Definitely a very silly supposition.


I would if I could.  The news show that showed the lengthy excerpts also 
had interviews with the filmmaker who made the documentary who basically 
confirmed what was shown in the excerpts from the time he spent at the 
compound in 1992.


I believe that this was reported by local radio reporters on site.
A fire started in a three story tower at the same time as the two 
story window shown on the tv coverage.


I thought about mentioning how Reagan and the military treated the press 
in Grenada and how that set the precedent, but decided it wasn't worthy 
of discussion.  If the news reporter got shot, you can bet his family 
would sue the government for letting him into the danger area.

The root cause of suspicion in my mind is why 100 people wouldn't flee 
a building that had numerous exits during the 30 minutes time it took 
to burn down.  Or why didn't they flee hours earlier when the tear gas was 
first introduced?  I can find no rational explanation for their behavior.

"Ever since the siege at Waco started the FBI spokesman has been
stressing how unstable and paranoid David Koresh was.  He stressed how
likely it was the the Branch Davidians would commit mass suicide.  He
was concerned with the safety of the children.
 
What did the FBI do to defuse the situation,  Did they try to reassure
Koresh?  DId the FBI offer medical assistance to the BD?  Did the FBI
offer them a supply of water when the BD pump stoped working?  Did the
permit Koresh to communicate with anyone outside the compound?
 
What the FBI did was harass the Branch Davidians as much as possible.
They kept powerful lights shining on the compound, shut off their
electrical power, put their pump out of action, assaulted their ears
with loud noise, cut off their communication with the outside and kept
limiting their permitter.  The stated goal was to put pressure on
David Koresh.
 
Was the FBI attempting to get Koresh to surrender or were they hoping
to get Koresh so mad that he and some of his followers would attack
the the tanks.
 
It appears that the tactics employed by the FBI did drive Koresh over
the edge.  The blame for the deaths should be shared by both the
federal experts whose tactics drove Koresh over the edge and the fools
at the ATF who planed the raid.
 
Stupidity and incompetence of the BATF and the FBI leadership have

I am participating in an NL-league that uses standard Rotisserie rules
except that the following catagories are used:

For position players:
	lowest batting average
	strike-outs
	caught-stealing
	errors

For pitchers:
	losses
	blown saves
	higest ERA
	'taters allowed

This is the fifth year that I've participated in this Blowtisserie
league.  Last year I won the pennant due primarily to the fact that
I had terrible pitching.  I would like to lower my batting average
which is rather high because I do have Jose Offerman (who made up
for this by helping me lock first place in errors).  Anyway,
someone offered:

Andres Gallaraga for Bud Black

I can afford to give up Bud Black because I still have Kyle Abbott.
However, I am afraid of Andres actually doing well this season.
Should I make the trade or not?

The Centaur that is being built for T4 would be a better bet to integrate 
onto the Proton as the T4/Centaur is designed for the Extremely Harsh 
envorinment of the T4 launch. It is also closer to 4 m in diameter. 

You've hit on the real kicker, however. The Centaur is pressure stabilized. 
It cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks. Additionally, 
the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to ~+/- 5 psi. 
That is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train. The pressure 
stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance. On numerous occasions
(when I was there 88-91) the AF wanted to see what it would take to make 
a non-pressure stabilized centaur. The answer -- a centaur not worth launching. 

The Atlas/Centaur does not require on-pad integration, however the T4/Centaur
does. I believe the on-pad integration is to a great extent due to the 
cleanliness requirements and PFL configuration, so maybe something can be 
done there........



The addition of LOX/LH facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it 
lifts off. A LHe facility is also needed. I don't know what the proton uses 
for fuel, but since they are derived from ICBM's I would suspect that they 
use storable propellants which don't have the ullage problem that cryo's 
do. If there is no cryo at the sight at all, the addition of these systems 
could be big $$, not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with 
providing centaur GSE to Russia. That issue alone might be enough to kill 
this idea.

You all know how things turned out.  The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees

expected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.

The Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn't have surprised
anybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the
Angels and Royals.  They clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in
June.  The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit, while the Twins
dropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.

...

This is taken a little out of context and I'm not flaming Jason...it's just
that this was the proverbial straw....

I grow a little weary of the allegations (here, the media, people on the
street) that the BD's had all these ""horrible illegal weapons and other
paraphenalia of destruction capable of blowing tanks 50 feet into the air...""
and then, without missing a beat, discuss how the BD's willfully commited
mass suicide, or killed their own less fanatical and *then* commited mass
suicide, etc., etc.

If the BD's had all these things and intended to ""blow up their abode, blow up
Waco, blow up the entire country, or whatever suits your fancy, what happened
to all the violence they were supposed to unleash? Why wouldn't they have ""gone
out in the proverbial blaze of glory"" and ""come out shooting"" with an attitude
of ""let's take as many of those dogs as possible with us""?

Instead, they seemed to have preferred death to whatever they thought was in
store for them at the government's hands.

It's totally immaterial whether they were all crazy, all fanatics, all followers
of the antichrist, haters of the government, practicers of weird lifestyles, or
whatever...they must have felt that they were being pressured into renouncing
their beliefs, however how strange or lunatic those beliefs might appear to ""you
and me"". There is much precedent for such devotion to cause.

My conclusion at this point is that the ""authorities"" seriously misread their
danger to society (else why did the BD's not do as suggested above) and/or chose
this incident to make some heinous point or satisfy some internal agenda, up to
and including AG J. Renbo using this as an opportunity to assert her manhood.

Some people really do believe it is better to die than be subjected to what
they perceive as the godless government. When I force myself to not judge
others by my own personal standards and beliefs, I can almost admire their
stand.

I surely believe in the Constitution but I don't know that I have such strength
of conviction as evidenced by the BD's.

#I use xwd/xpr (from the X11R5 dist.) and various programs of the

I don't like xpr. It gives (at least, the X11R4 version does) louzy
output: the hardcopy looks very grainy to me.
Instead, I use pnmtops. This takes full advantage PostScript, and
lets the printer do the dirty job of dithering a (graylevel)
image to black and white dots.

So: if you have a PostScript printer, try:
	xwdtopnm <xwdfile> |	# convert to PPM
	[ppmtopgm |]		# .. to graylevel for smaller file to print
	pnmtops -noturn |	# .. to PostScript
	lpr			# print

pnmtops Has several neat options, but use them with care:
If you want your image to be 4"" wide, use:
	pnmtops -noturn -scale 100 -width 4
-noturn Prevents the image from being rotated (if it is wider than it
	is high)
-width 4 Specifies the PAPER width (not the image width - see below)
-scale 100 Is used because if the image is small, it may fit within a
	width less than 4"", and will thus be printed smaller than 4"" wide.
	If you first scale it up a lot, it will certainly not fit in 4"", and
	will be scaled down by pnmtops automatically to fit the specified
	paper width. 
	In short: pnmtops will scale an image down to fit the paper size,
	but it will not blow it up automatically.

Hope this helps.

<Moral Driver distinctions deleted>


Compare the Driver to an urge such as Jealousy, where there is an urge
and an ""object"". The jealousy does not technically exist until the object
is apparent. However, the capacity to be jealous is presumably still there
even though it is not detectable.

Your description of the Unbilical took me three passes to understand (!) but
I get the gist and I have to tentatively agree. I think our two definitions
can sit side by side without too much trouble, though. I haven't attempted to
define the reason behind the Moral Driver (only hinted through the essence of
each Moral). Your definition hints that animals are also capable of a
similar morality - Simians have a similar Social Order to ourselves and it is
easy to anthropomorphize with these animals. Is this possible or have I
misunderstood?


My p.s. thoughts falls roughly in line with John Stuart Mill and
his writings on Utilitarianism. I have no particular plan (except to do
my bit - personal ethics AND social work). My opinion (for what it is worth)
is that the Authority for each Moral must be increased somehow, and that this
will probably take several generations to be effective. I don't think that the
list of Morals has changed for Society significantly, though . The Authority element
may come from our authority figures and roles models (see Eric Berne and his
transactional analysis work [+ Mavis Klein] for references) and this is what
gives rise to a deterioration of moral standards in the long term.

I've had some more thoughts on my definitions:

I've was thinking that I should add Moral Character to the list of definitions
in order to get a dynamic version of the Moral Nature (ie. the interplay of
the Moral Code and associated Authorities). A suitable analogy might be a
graphic equaliser on a HiFi system - the Moral Nature being the set of
frequencies and the chosen 'amplitudes', and the Moral Character being the
spectrum over time.

Conscience is a little more difficult because I can't define it as the
reasoning of a person between actions in the context of his Moral Nature
because Conscience seems to cut in most of the time unbidden and often
unwanted. I think Conscience is manifest when a decision is made at a given
time which compromises one's Moral Nature. My Conscience fits in more with
Freud's SuperEgo (plus the Moral Driver) with the stimulous being the
urges or Freud's Id. The reasoning that I mentioned before is Freud's Ego,
I suppose. If the Moral Driver is part of the Id then the reason why
Conscience cuts in unbidden is partially explained. The question is ""what
provides the stimulous to activate the Moral driver?"". I think I need some
more time with this one.

That's about it for now!

There were two major native factions opposing each other and the germans,
It was basically useless to the germans (no production) and a drain on their
resources (a armored division and a couple of infantry divisions) Which if
my memory is correct, were kind of stuck there up until the allies accepted
their surrender.  (I think that the allies also let the germans keep some 
of their weapons for self defense unitil they were able to get to the

That would not explain why widely separated detectors, such as on Ulysses
and PVO and Ginga et al., would see a burst at the same time(*).  In fact, be-
fore BATSE, having this widely separated ""Interplanetary Network"" was the
only sure way to locate a random burst.  With only one detector, one cannot
locate a burst (except to say ""It's somewhere in the field of view."").  With
two detectors, one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector
to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky.  With three detectors,
one gets intersecting annuli, giving two possible locations.  If one of these
locations is impossible (because, say, the Earth blocked that part of the 
sky), voila, you have an error box.

BATSE, by having 8 detectors of its own, can do its own location determination,
but only to within about 3 degrees (would someone at GSFC, like David, like
to comment on the current state of location determination?).  Having inde-
pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty.

You did touch on something that you didn't mean to, though.  Some believe
(in a reference that I have somewhere) that absorption-like features seen
in a fraction of GRBs can actually be caused by the detector.  It would be
a mean, nasty God, though, that would have a NaI crystal act like a 10^12 Gauss

God being unknowable, I can't comment on His motives, but it would be
distressing if He allowed us to misunderstand Him through no fault of 
our own.  For sanity's sake we must assume, if we believe in Him at all,
that His message comes through somehow.  The question is whether it comes 
through immediately to every individual, or is contained in a complex 
canon that must be interpreted by experts in consultation with one another, 
or is transmitted directly through appointed representatives who are free
to interpret, extend and modify the canon.  If God's message is indeed
mediated, the further problem arises as to whether the individual under-
stands the mediated message fully and clearly.  Since the responsibility 
for understanding lies ultimately with the individual, we must assume that 
God in His benevolence guides each individual to the appropriate source 
for that individual, whereof the person may or may not drink. 
 
 
 
Your example is complicated in our age by the thin line between morality
and politeness.  You might have said ""burp"", for burping and swearing carry
about the same stigma today.  If you are talking about ""taking the Lord's 
name in vain"" as a serious transgression, then this example is more a case of 
hypocrisy than of varying moral codes.
 
If there is an absolute moral code, propositions or laws in that code apply
absolutely and universally, by definition.  Conceivably some moral codes
could be subsets of the universal code, as you say at the outset.  So, for
example, God's code could include, ""Thou shalt not create Beings without
a hospitable planet to live on"", but this law would be inapplicable to us.
Nevertheless, we would be entitled to suppose that all laws applicable
to us are also applicable to God.
 
But when you begin to ask what laws might appear in God's moral code, you have
a sense of the absurdity of the question.  Does God make laws for Himself to
follow?  Perhaps God is not the sort of being to which the category ""morality""
can be sensibly applied.",religion

where people from Libanon flee to during more extensive bombings, so
there's
a constant flow of refugees entering and leaving Tyre (articles mentioned
thousands of people entering and leaving this place).

As a ""favorite"", sure.  As lethal, not likely.  A study of violence in

It might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns
that they would find a way to kill as often with knives.  If this were
so, knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide
would be expected to show a low fatality rate, and knife attacks in
cities where guns were not so widely used (like Vancouver) would show
a higher fatality rate.  But the Nat'l Commission on the Causes and
Prevention of Violence Task Force analyzed the data and found this
not to be the case.  It appeared to them that as the number of knife
attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks
(which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants),
the proportion of FATAL knife attacks did NOT increase relative to the
proportion of gun attacks.  In fact, the reverse was true.

What was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on
the part of the assailant to kill.  Fatalities caused by knife tended
to show a single-mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave
physical injury: multiple stabs wounds, wounds concentrated about the
head neck and chest, etc.  Most gun homicides did not show this
pattern.  Rather, more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of
rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim.

: drug related killings here, the USA would look a whole lot more peaceful.

There are a lot of factors which make a difference.  Actually, I'm not
fond of making ANY kind of social parallels between Europeans and
Americans. There are more cultural, beahvioral and economic
differences between us than similarities.  I just sort of found
myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks.  I
don't think we could ever attain the low levels of European violent
crime here in the US, whether we banned guns or required every
law-abiding citizen to carry a loaded Uzi.

On the other hand, we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more
culturally similar, namely the Canadians.  In fact, an exhaustive,
seven-year study has already been done of the respective crime rates
of Vancouver, British Columbia and Seattle, Washington... cities
with roughly the same population, urban economy, geography
and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control.

In Seattle, handguns may be purchased legally for self-defense.  After
a 30-day waiting period, a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed
weapon.  The recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted.

In Vancouver, self-defense is not considered a valid or legal reason
to purchase a handgun.  Concealed weapons are not permitted.
Recreational uses of handguns (target shooting, collecting) are
regulated by the province.  Purchase of a handgun requires a
restricted-weapons permit.  A permit to carry may be obtained in
order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs.  Handguns
transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box.
In short, gun control but not unreasonably so.

Both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws.  Convictions for
gun-related offenses carry similar penalties.  The researchers
studied all cases of robbery, assault (simple and aggravated),
burglary and homicides occurring in Seattle and Vancouver from
1/1/80 to 12/31/86. In defining the cases, they used the same
standard: the FBI's Unified Crime Report.

Results: during the seven-year study the annual rate of robbery in
Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in Vancouver
(1.09 / 1.11).  Burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates (.99).
18,925 assaults were recorded in Seattle versus 12,034 in
Vancouver.  The risk of being a victim of a simple assault in
Seattle was found to be only slightly higher than Vancouver (1.18 /
1.15) and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher
(1.16 / 1.12).  However, when aggravated assaults were subdivided by
weapon and the mechanism of assault, a clear pattern emerged.
Although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated
assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons, firearms were
far more likely to be used in Seattle.  In fact, 7.7 times as often.

Over the seven-year study, 388 homicides occurred in Seattle
(11.3 per 100,000) vs. 204 homicides in Vancouver (6.9 per 100,000).
After adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations,
the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in Seattle, as
compared to Vancouver, was found to be 1.63.

When homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death, the rate
of homicide by knives and other weapons (excluding firearms) in
Seattle was found to be almost identical to that in Vancouver.
Virtually ALL of the increased risk of death in Seattle was due to
a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms.  Handguns
accounted for roughly 85% of homicides involving firearms.  Handguns
were 4.8 times more likely to be used in homicides in Seattle than
in Vancouver.

The authors of the report also investigated ""legally justifiable""
homicides (self-defense).  Only 32 such homicides occurred during
the seven-year study, 11 of which were committed by police.  Only
21 cases of civilians acting in self-defense occurrred: 17 in
Seattle and 4 in Vancouver.  Only 13 involved firearms.  After
excluding these cases, there was virtually no impact on these
earlier findings.

-------

This is, I feel, a very fair report.  One might even make the
argument that it is biased against Canada as a whole because
Vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times
that of Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto while Seattle reports
annual homicide rates only half to two-thirds that of NYC,
Chicago, Los Angeles and Houston.

Critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access
to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because
persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a
gun or will kill by other means.  This report shows differently.
If the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by
the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons, we
could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to
be higher in Vancouver than in Seattle.  However, during the study
interval, Vancouver's rate of homicide by weapons other than guns
was not significantly higher than that in Seattle, suggesting that
few would-be assailants switched to homicide by other methods.

As well, ready access to handguns for self-defense by law-abiding
citizens was not endorsed in this report.  Although Seattle did
experience a higher rate of firearm death for self-defense, these
cases accounted for less than 4% of the homicides in both cities
during the course of the study period.  And, as was reported,
Seattle apparently didn't enjoy relief from any crime category
over Vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for
self-defense.

The reference frame makes the speed relative.  But what's interesting

Every person off, a bullet moving 60mph.

Sorry!! :-)

Call the four points A, B, C and D. Any three of them must be
non-collinear (otherwise all three could not lie on the surface
of a sphere) and all four must not be coplaner (otherwise either
they cannot all lie on a sphere or they define an infinity of them).

A, B and C define a circle. The perpendicular bisectors of AB, BC
and CA  meet in a point (P, say) which is the centre of this circle.
This circle must lie on the surface of the desired sphere.

Consider the normal to the plane ABC passing through P. All points
on this normal are equidistant from A, B and C and its circle (in
fact it is a diameter of the desired sphere). Take the plane
containing this normal and D (if D lies on the normal any
plane containing the normal will do); this plane is at right angles
to the ABC one.

Let E be the point (there are normally two of them) on the circumference
of the ABC circle which lies in this plane. We need a point Q on the
normal such that EQ = DQ. But the intersection of the perpendicular
bisector of ED and the normal is such a point (and it exists since D is
not in the plane ABC, and so ED is not at right angles to the normal).


Algorithm:

Is the sphere well defined?
    (1) Check that A and B are not coincident (=> failure).
    (2) Find the line AB and check that C does not lie on it (=> failure).

I think this is a little inaccurate, based on Feynman's account of the
software-development process *before* the standdown.  Fred is basically
correct:  no sophisticated tools, just a lot of effort and painstaking
care.  But they got this one right *before* Challenger; Feynman cited
the software people as exemplary compared to the engine people.  (He
also noted that the software people were starting to feel management
pressure to cut corners, but hadn't had to give in to it much yet.)

Among other things, the software people worked very hard to get things
right for the major pre-flight simulations, and considered a failure
during those simulations to be nearly as bad as an in-flight failure.
As a result, the number of major-simulation failures could be counted
on one hand, and the number of in-flight failures was zero.

As Fred mentioned elsewhere, this applies only to the flight software.
Software that runs experiments is typically mostly put together by the
experimenters, and gets nowhere near the same level of Tender Loving Care.

"I produced an error last week about CHORION:


I abhor publishing trash (I abhor it of myself even more than I do from
others, but since I do not present myself as an authority on the subject, I do
not feel dishonest, though I do openly admit ignorance and incompetence in
this example).  Thus I felt honor bound to do a better set of research
specifically on the word.  First it should be noted that Greek grammar is not
as tough as I first assumed (it is not nontrivial by any means, and I still am
not competent with it, but it is not as opaque as I had thought).  It turns
out that while the Index for the Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich ""Greek Lexicon"" renders
each verse in order, each word within a verse is put in greek alphabetical
order.  Thus while the the meaning of the verse is decipherable, the syntax is
far from clear.  On the other hand, a Greek-English Intralinear Bible makes
things a lot more comprehendable.  And yes, the word for field in Acts 1:18 is
indeed ""chorion."" 

Now I've checked several Greek-English lexicons:

	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Louw and Nida
	""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament""
	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Grimm
	""Word study Concordance,"" Tynsdale
	""A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other 
	 early Christian Writings,"" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich
	""The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,"" Perschbacher

In each case the meaning of the word Chorion was given variously as:

	A space, place, region, district, field, area, ""country place,"" 
	land, farm, estate, ""a bit of tillage"", and similar meanings.

Nowhere do any of these books mention anything about ""grave."" As some of these 
books go into great detail, I would be very surprised to find that these books 
are all inadequate and Mr Archer is the only competent scholar in Greek.  I 
think it more likely that Mr Archer's investigations into ""contradictions"" to 
be once again, as your friend said it, ""lacking in substance,"" and thus Archer 
is again shown worthless as an expert witness (By the way Mr DeCenso, I would 
have honorably presented my results on this matter, even if I had found them
to support Mr Archer's contentions). 

By the way, among these lexicons, (eg: Robinson's) is the definition of
""agros,"" the word used in Matthew 27 to describe the field bought.  The word
""agros"" is defined as ""a field in the country."" Chorion is specifically noted
as a synonym to agros.  This is significant, as it is evidence of how silly
Bullinger's exegisis was, which stated that the word for ""field"" in Matthew
(ie: agros) is different from the word for ""field"" in Acts (ie: chorion), and
thus we must be talking about two different fields (Of course you already
admit how stupid Bullinger's exegisis is, but this was a small serendipity
which drives the point home). 

So as of now, unless Mr DeCenso show compelling reasons to believe otherwise
(eg: a reputable scholar with reputable references), I consider this 
particular issue closed.  See Mr DeCenso, now you can go on to answer
questions about the denials of Peter, the day of the Crucifixion, Tyre, and 
the fact that the author of Matthew quoted from the wrong prophet in
discussing the ""Potter's Field.""

Off the top of my head, I might try:

Given: p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4

Find:  p_c (center of sphere determined by p_1, ..., p_4), 
       dist(p_c, p_i) (radius)

p_c is the same distance from our four points, so
dist(p_c,p_1) = dist(p_c,p_2) = dist(p_c,p_3) = dist(p_c,p_4) 

Of course, we can square the whole thing to get rid of square roots:
distsq(p_c,p_1) = distsq(p_c,p_2) = distsq(p_c,p_3) = distsq(p_c,p_4) 

Plug in the variables into the distance formula, simplify, and the 
x^2_c, y^2_c, and z^2_c terms cancel out, leaving you with three 
linearly independent equations and three unknowns (x_c, y_c, z_c).  
Solve using your favorite method.  :)

Does running Jim's articles through 'discord' make them more

Or has 'discord' turned Jim's articles into an angst-ridden poem
about making choices in a world filled with uncertainty, yet being
held responsible for the choices we make?  Do the geese symbolize
an inner frustration with ambiguity, a desire that everything be
black and white, with no shades of gray?  Does the ""getaway car""
tell us that to try to renounce the existential nature of our
being is not to ""get away"" from responsibility for our actions,
but rather to take the role of the passive accomplice, the
""driver"" of the getaway car, as it were?  Does the juxtaposition
of man and machine, car and driver, reveal a subtext: an internal

re: is ""John Q. Public with a gun"" protected?




Miller was convicted of owning a sawed-off shotgun and not paying the
NFA '34 tax.  Snatches of the court's decision:

The Second Amendment was intended to ""assure the continuation and render 
possible the effectiveness of such a force [the militia]... It must be 
interpreted and applied with that end in view.""

The militia includes ""all males physically capable of acting in concert 
for the common defense.""

However, regarding sawed-off shotguns, ""certainly it is not within 
judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military 
equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.""

""Judicial notice"" is the term of art here -- it meant that no such
evidence had been formally presented.  This is different from claiming
that they had ruled that it wasn't.


I'm not talking about plain shotguns in war -- I'm talking about short-
barrelled (""sawed-off"") shotguns in war.

Compare Revolutionary War blunderbusses; luparas in the Spanish-American 
War; and trench-cleaners in WW I.  They were also put to good use by
US soldiers in WW II, not to mention being invaluable to ""tunnel rats"" 
in Vietnam, but, of course, ""Miller"" took place in 1939.


Here is my quandary:  you seem to be arguing that certain types of 
guns fall outside the scope of the Second.  This isn't a useful argument 
unless you believe that some significant gun or class of gun belongs
in that class.  

I think we both agree that zip guns probably aren't protected.  Maybe 
we also both agree that all the weapons that random state governments 
have been banning or trying to ban because they have ""no sporting purpose"" 
and ""no provate citizen would ever need these guns"" DO fall under the 
protection of the Second.  

So, given that damn near any gun of any practical utility is or has at 
some time been used by the military, even if only for marksmanship 
training purposes, I need to understand why you are intent on pressing 
this point, arguing that that SOMETHING is not protected by the Second.

             The Lunar Tele-operation Model One (LTM1)
             =========================================
                        By David H. Mitchell
                          March 23, 1993
 
INTRODUCTION:
 
In order to increase public interest in space-based and lunar operations, a
real miniature lunar-like environment is being constructed on which to test
tele-operated models. These models are remotely-controlled by individuals
located world-wide using their personal computers, for EduTainment
purposes.
Not only does this provide a test-bed for simple tele-operation and
tele-presence activities but it also provides for the sharing of
information
on methods of operating in space, including, but not limited to, layout of
a
lunar colony, tele-operating machines for work and play, disseminating
educational information, providing contests and awards for creativity and
achievement and provides a new way for students worldwide to participate in
Twenty-First century remote learning methods.
 
Because of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all ages, interests
and
skills can contribute scenery and murals, models and structures,
interfacing
and electronics, software and graphics. In operation LTM1 is an evolving
playground and laboratory that can be used by children, students and
professionals worldwide. Using a personal computer at home or a terminal at
a participating institution a user is able to tele-operate real models at
the
LTM1 base for experimental or recreational purposes. Because a real
facility
exists, ample opportunity is provided for media coverage of the
construction
of the lunar model, its operation and new features to be added as suggested
by the users themselves.
 
This has broad inherent interest for a wide range of groups:
 - tele-operations and virtual reality research
 - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation
 - astronomy and space planetariums and science centers
 - art and theater
 - bbs and online network users
 - software and game developers
 - manufacturers and retailers of model rockets, cars and trains
 - children
 - the child in all of us
 
LTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:
 
A room 14 feet by 8 feet contains the base lunar layout. The walls are used
for murals of distant moon mountains, star fields and a view of the earth.
The ""floor"" is the simulated lunar surface. A global call for contributions
is hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and
creation of scale models of lunar colony elements, scenery, and
machine-lets.
 
 The LTM1 initial design has 3 tele-operated machinelets:
 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;
 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and
 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface.
 
 Each machinelet has a small TV camera utilizing a CCD TV chip mounted on
 it. A personal computer digitizes the image (including reducing picture
 content and doing data-compression to allow for minimal images to be sent
 to the operator for control purposes) and also return control signals.
 
The first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model trains
with TV cameras built in are almost off-the-shelf items and control
electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal. The user will
receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their
data link to LTM1.
 
Next, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspended from a
servo-motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the
SSTO
to be controlled by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar
landscape and land.
 
Finally, some tank models will be modified to be CCD TV chip equipped
bulldozerlets. The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operators
worldwide
to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and
takeoff, traveling and doing work. The entire system is based on
commercially
available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the
interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced
ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developers.
 
By taking a graphically oriented communications program (Dmodem) and adding
a tele-operations screen and controls, the necessary user interface can be
provided in under 80 man hours.
 
PLAN OF ACTION:
 
The Diaspar Virtual Reality Network has agreed to sponsor this project by
providing a host computer network and Internet access to that network.
Diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction
of the lunar model. Diaspar has, in stock, the electronic tanks that can be
modified and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agrees to provide ""rail stock""
for the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical
communications package and modify it for control of the machines-lets.
An initial ""ground breaking"" with miniature shovels will be performed for
a live photo-session and news conference on April 30, 1993. The initial
models will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be started for
historical purposes. It is not expected that this event will be completely
serious or solemn. The lunar colony will be declared open for additional
building, operations and experiments. A photographer will be present and
the photographs taken will be converted to .gif images for distribution
world-wide to major online networks and bbs's. A press release will be
issued
calling for contributions of ideas, time, talent, materials and scale
models
for the simulated lunar colony.
 
A contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then
be
announced. Universities will be invited to participate, the goal being to
find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of
the lunar colony model. Field trips to LTM1 can be arranged and at that
time
the results of the class work will be added to the model. Contributors will
then be able to tele-operate any contributed machine-lets once they return
to
their campus.
 
A monthly LTM1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via
conventional means to the media. Any major new tele-operated equipment
addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media.
Having a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo
opportunity for the television community. Especially since the ""action""
will
be controlled by people all over the world. Science fiction writers will be
invited to issue ""challenges"" to engineering and human factors students at
universities to build and operate the tele-operated equipment to perform
lunar tasks. Using counter-weight and pulley systems, 1/6 gravity may be
simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges.
 
The long term goal is creating world-wide interest, education,
experimentation
and remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 has the potential of being a
long
term global EduTainment method for space activities and may be the generic
example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited
to space EduTainment. All of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can
lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars!
 
CONCLUSION:
 
EduTainment is the blending of education and entertainment. Anyone who has
ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a
globally available layout for recreation, education and experimentation
purposes. By creating a tele-operated model lunar colony we not only create
world-wide publicity, but also a method of trying new ideas that require
real
(not virtual) skills and open a new method for putting people's minds in
space.

Actually, the reboost will probably be done last, so that there is a fuel
reserve during the EVAs (in case they have to chase down an adrift
astronaut or something like that).  But yes, you've got the idea -- the
reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up.


Somebody has to build that thruster module; it's not an off-the-shelf
item.  Nor is it a trivial piece of hardware, since it has to include
attitude control (HST's own is not strong enough to compensate for things
like thruster imbalance), guidance (there is no provision to feed gyro
data from HST's own gyros to an external device), and separation (you
don't want it left attached afterward, if only to avoid possible
contamination after the telescope lid is opened again).  You also get
to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is
done and HST is inaccessible to the shuttle (the lid stays closed for
the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from
thrusters and the like).

The original plan was to use the Orbital Maneuvering Vehicle to do the
reboost.  The OMV was planned to be a sort of small space tug, well
suited to precisely this sort of job.  Unfortunately, it was costing
a lot to develop and the list of definitely-known applications was
relatively short, so it got cancelled.",space

Was THAT your argument.  Well, you didn't make it very well.  You started 
from the questionable premise that the fire was necessarily an act of

Depends. If you assume the existance of a working SSTO like DC, on billion
$$ would be enough to put about a quarter million pounds of stuff on the
moon. If some of that mass went to send equipment to make LOX for the
transfer vehicle, you could send a lot more. Either way, its a lot
more than needed.

This prize isn't big enough to warrent developing a SSTO, but it is

"ARIANESPACE FLIGHT 56

(Flight V.56 was originally intended to carry the Hughes HS-601 series 
Galaxy IV satellite, but the payload was withdrawn just prior to flight.)

The 56th Ariane launch is now scheduled to place the ASTRA 1C and ARSENE 
satellites into an improved geostationary transfer orbit (GTO), with 
inclination reduced to 5 degrees and apogee altitude increased by 150 km.
This will be the 28th launch of an Ariane 4 and the first in the 42L 
configuration, with 2 liquid strap-on boosters (PAL).  It will be launched
from the newly refurbished Ariane launch complex ELA 2, in Kourou - French 
Guiana.

The launch vehicle performance requirement for this mission is 3,147 kg
of which 2,944 kg represents the satellite mass.  The total vehicle mass
at liftoff is 361,778 kg.


Required Orbit Characteristics:
  Perigee Altitude ..... 200 km
  Apogee Altitude ...... 36,160 km at injection 
  Inclination ..........   5 degrees


The Ariane 42L lift-off for Flight 56 is scheduled on Thursday,
April 29, 1993, as soon as possible within the following launch 
window:

     Kourou Time        GMT (04/30/93)      Washington, DC
     21:52 - 22:50      00:52 - 01:50       20:52 - 21:50


LAUNCH VEHICLE:

Ariane 42L.  This is a three-stage liquid fueled launcher with two liquid 
fueled strap-on boosters.  The first stage (L220) is built by Aerospatiale,
and is powered by 4 liquid fueled Viking V engines.  The second stage (L33)
is built by MBB Erno and is powered by a single Viking IV engine.  Both the
Viking IV and V engines are manufactured by SEP.  The first and second stages
use a biliquid UH25/N2O4 fuel. The third stage (H10) is built by Aerospatiale,
and is powered by a cryogenic H2/O2 fueled HM-7B engine built by SEP. The two
strap-on boosters (PAL) are each powered by a Viking VI engine, also built 
by SEP, which use the same biliquid fuel as the first and second stages.  
The fully assembled launch vehicle stands 56 meters high on the pad.  
It uses the Type 01 Ariane Short payload fairing.


Flight Profile:

 +02:21  Liquid strap-on booster jettison
 +03:11  First stage separation
 +03:18  Second stage ignition
 +04:10  Fairing jettison
 +05:21  Second stage separation

 +17:30  Third stage shutdown / orbit injection
 +19:56  ASTRA 1C separation
 +22:36  Cyclade adapter separation
 +24:26  ARSENE separation
 +28:47  End of Ariane mission 56


PAYLOADS:

ASTRA 1C is the third spacecraft in the fleet of ""Societe Europeenne
des Satellites"" to broadcast direct TV to homes all over Europe.
Built by Hughes, it will be the second HS-601 launched by Ariane.

  Total mass at lift-off .... 2,790 kg
  Mass at GEO insertion ..... 1,700 kg
  Dry mass .................. 1,180 kg     
  On-board power ............ 3,300 W (end of life)
  Nominal lifetime .......... 15 years     
  Span of solar panels ...... 21 m
  On-Orbit position ......... 19.2 degrees east, over Africa.

 Transmission capacity:  
   34 channels in Ku-band, via 18 transponders.

 In-flight operations:
   Solar array deployment ............ about 6 days after lift-off
   First of 3 apogee motor firings ... about 40 hours after lift-off 
                                       at 4th apogee


ARSENE is the first spacecraft built by the European Space Industry
for the benefit of the world amateur radio community.  

  Total mass at lift-off .... 154 kg
  Mass at GEO insertion .....  98 kg
  Dry mass ..................  97 kg     
  On-board power ............ 42 W (end of life)
  Nominal lifetime .......... 3 years     
  Spacecraft dimensions ..... 1.1m x .96m
  Orbital parameters ........ 20000/36000 km, 0 inclination, period 17:30.

 Transmission capacity:  
   S-band:  1 transponder at 2.446 ghz
   VHF/UHF: 145/435 mhz 


LAUNCH COVERAGE:

All Ariane missions are broadcast live via satellite from Kourou. 
Coverage begins at 30 minutes before launch and continues until 
all payloads have been deployed.  This mission will likely be carried
in the US on Galaxy 6, however it could be Galaxy 7 or another satellite.
(What is the European satellite normally used for Ariane coverage?)

Harder than what?  I note that almost all revolvers work the same way,

""these Glocks are dangerous because they're not like my 1911/S&W third

Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit
a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road
splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split
is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence.
There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome
seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and
Alomar is not a home run hitter.


Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst
defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's
fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up
with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding
the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.

Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.

Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players

It's not a cliche, and (unlike your comments below) it's not a tautology.
It needn't have been true.  If every pitcher in baseball were essentially
the same in quality (i.e. if the variance of pitching ability were much
smaller than the variance of batting ability), then scoring runs would be
much more important than preventing them, simply because the *ability* to
actively prevent runs would be much weaker.


If that's your point, you should have said so.  What you in fact said was
""Pitching and defense win championships"", and later ""Pitching is the essence
of baseball"".  Neither of which says what you are now claiming was ""your 
point"", and neither of which is true.


And you accuse Sherri of mouthing cliches!?


It's not clear to me at all that this is true.  In high-scoring games, the
team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time.  In low-
scoring games, the split is essentially 50/50 regardless of team ability.


I thought you said ""pitching and defense win championships"" and ""pitching is
the essence of baseball"".

Well, actually, most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is
based on some fantasy of how it happened. But that's OK, I understand you
have a hockey background. Stats like ""plus/minus"" make RBI look good.


OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which
I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please
answer yes or no, Roger:
 Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?
AL only, please.

For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact
that a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the
team scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,
hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a
rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,
for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.
So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that
they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other
things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack
Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238
for Boston), the ""Red Jays"" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or
enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola
pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in
(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you
really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs
his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this
analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would
necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but
that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and
evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that ""had Morris
performed as Viola did, his team would have been better off.""

looking at a Glock .40S&W and the S&W 4006 a couple of weeks ago and the
safties on the guns were very different.  The saftey on the 4006 seemed a lot
more ""safe""  (for lack of a better word) than the one on the Glock.  Of course
this could also be a bad thing if you were to pull the gun on somebody.  You
would spend more time fiddling around turning the safety off.  Personally I
like the Glocks because they are very light and I think they look really cool
(guess that's why they use them in so many movies) but I wouldn't get one as
my first semi-auto because of the safety.  I would prefer more training with
a ""traditional"" semi-auto (ala Colt .45) but of course that's just my opinion.",politics

A developable surface is s.t. you can lay it (or roll it) flat on the
plane (it may require you to give it a ""cut"" though...)

E.g., a cylinder, a cone, a plane (of course!) or any surface or patch
having vanishing Gaussian (intrinsic) curvature (i.e., with singular
Hessian, the matrix of 2nd derivatives for an adequate coordinate patch)
are ""developable"". In more technical words, a developable surface is
""locally isometric to a plane"" at all points.


Think also of the sphere (or the earth) which in a non-developable:
whatever way(s) you cut it, you will not be able to lay flat any pieces
of it... (its intrinsic curvature is nowhere vanishing).

For more details on this look at any book on differential geometry
which treats surfaces (2D manifolds); e.g., M. do Carmo's book:

@Book{Carmo76Differential,
  author =      {do Carmo, Manfredo P.},
  title =       {Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces},
  year =        1976,
  publisher =   {Prentice-Hall},

Dennis, I have worked on or written proposals worth tens of millions
of $$. Customers included government (including NASA), for profit and
non-profit companies. All expected a wrap (usually called a fee). Much
of the work involved allocating and costing the work of subcontractors.
The subcontractors where universities, for-profits, non-profits, and
even some of the NASA Centers for the Commercialization of Space. ALL
charged fees as part of the work. Down the street is one of the NASA
commercialization centers; they charge a fee.

Now, I'm sure your a competent engineer Dennis, but you clearly lack
experience in several areas. Your posts show that you don't understand
the importance of integration in large projects. You also show a lack
of understanding of costing efforts as shown by your belief that it
is reasonable to charge incremental costs for everything. This isn't
a flame, jsut a statement.

Your employer DOES charge a fee. You may not see it but you do.



Well there you are Dennis. As I said, they simply include the fee in
their overhead. Many seoparate the fee since the fee structure can
change depending on the customer.


Integration, Dennis, isn't overhead.


Dennis, Reston has been the only NASA agency working to reduce costs. When
WP 02 was hemoraging out a billion $$, the centers you love so much where
doing their best to cover it up and ignore the problem. Reston was the
only place you would find people actually interested in solving the
problems and building a station.


When you have a bit more experience Dennis, you will realize that
integration isn't overhead. It is the single most important part
of a successful large scale effort.


The story you refer to said that some NASA people blamed it on
Congress. Suprise suprise. The fact remains that it is the centers
you support so much who covered up the overheads and wouldn't address
the problems until the press published the story.

Are you saying the Reston managers where wrong to get NASA to address
the overruns? You approve of what the centers did to cover up the overruns?


You should know Dennis that NASA doesn't include transport costs for
resuply. That comes from the Shuttle budget. What they where saying
is that operational costs could be cut in half plus transport.


I do hope you can find the time to tell us just why it was wrong of
Reston to ask that the problems with WP 02 be addressed.

       As perhaps some insight into how this sort of thing works, the
local college newspaper had a big crusade to have the U.T. police
release crime stats.  (The school claimed that to do so would violate
federal education records privacy laws).  They swore up and down they
weren't interested in student discipline records, only for stats so people
could make an evaluation of how safe the campus was.

       It was barely a week after crime stats were released before the
Daily Beacon had an editorial calling for student disciplinary stats
to be released, because they complained certain segments of the campus
population were treated administratively rather than turned over to the
police and therefore the criminal states weren't accurate.

You're assuming that ""go solar"" = ""photovoltaic"".  Solar dynamic power

"McDonnell Douglas rolls out DC-X

        HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- On a picture-perfect Southern
California day, McDonnell Douglas rolled out its DC-X rocket ship last
Saturday.  The company hopes this single-stage rocket technology
demonstrator will be the first step towards a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)
rocket ship.

        The white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the White Sands
Missile Range in New Mexico this week.  Flight tests will start in
mid-June.

        Although there wasn't a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for
SSTO research remains cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60
million for the DC-X -- can't itself afford to fund full development of a
follow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundreds of millions required for
a sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO is passing a tin cup among its sister government
agencies.

        SDIO originally funded SSTO research as a way to cut the costs for
orbital deployments of space-based sensors and weapns.  However, recent
changes in SDI's political marching orders and budget cuts have made SSTO
less of a priority.  Today, the agency is more interested in using DC-X as
a step towards a low-cost, reusable sounding rocket.

        SDIO has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies,
said Col.  Simon ""Pete"" Worden, SDIO's deputy for technology.  But Worden
declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the
program. ""I didn't make colonel by telling my contractors how much money I
have available to spend,"" he quipped at a press conference at McDonnell
Douglas Astronautics headquarters.

        While SDIO has lowered its sights on the program's orbital
objective, agency officials hail the DC-X as an example of the ""better,
faster, cheaper"" approach to hardware development.  The agency believes
this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that ""leapfrog"" ahead of
evolutionary technology developments.

        Worden said the DC-X illustrates how a ""build a little, test a
little"" approach can produce results on time and within budget.  He said
the program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months --
showed how today's engineers could move beyond the ""miracles of our
parents' time.""

        ""The key is management,"" Worden said. ""SDIO had a very light hand
on this project.  We had only one overworked major, Jess Sponable.""

        Although the next phase may involve more agencies, Worden said
lean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be
crucial. ""It's essential we do not end up with a large management
structure where the price goes up exponentially.""

        SDIO's approach also won praise from two California members of the
House Science, Space and Technology Committee. ""This is the direction
we're going to have to go,"" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee's
Democratic chairman. ""Programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren't
sustainable....NASA hasn't learned it yet.  SDIO has.""

        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown's Republican colleague, went further.
Joking that ""a shrimp is a fish designed by a NASA design team,""
Rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it
were left to the civil space agency.

        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district includes McDonnell
Douglas, also criticized NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-staged
rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology. ""Let's not
build fancy ammunition with capsules on top.  Let's build a spaceship!""

         Although Rohrbacher praised SDIO's sponsorship, he said the
private sector needs to take the lead in developing SSTO technology.

        McDonnell Douglas, which faces very uncertain prospects with its
C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom programs, were more cautious
about a large private secotro commitment. ""On very large ventures,
companies put in seed money,"" said Charles Ordahl, McDonnell Douglas'
senior vice president for space systems. ""You need strong government
investments.""

        While the government and industry continue to differ on funding
for the DC-XA, they agree on continuing an incremental approach to
development.  Citing corporate history, they liken the process to Douglas
Aircraft's DC aircraft.  Just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for
the DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could
eventually lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).

        Flight tests this summer at White Sands will ""expand the envelope""
of performance, with successive tests increasing speed and altitude.  The
first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering, verticle
take-off and landing.  The second series will send the unmanned DC-X up to
5,000 feet.  The third and final series will take the craft up to 20,000
feet.

        Maneuvers will become more complex on third phase.  The final
tests will include a ""pitch-over"" manever that rotates the vehicle back
into a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legged landing.

        The flight test series will be supervised by Charles ""Pete""
Conrad, who performed similar maneuvers on the Apollo 12 moon landing.
Now a McDonnell Douglas vice president, Conrad paised the vehicles
aircraft-like approach to operations.  Features include automated
check-out and access panels for easy maintainance.

        If the program moves to the next stage, engine technology will
become a key consideration.  This engine would have more thrust than the
Pratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engines used on the DC-X.  Each motor uses liquid
hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14,760 pounds of
thrust

        Based on the engine used in Centaur upper stages, the A-5 model
has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three-to-on
throttling capability.  It also is designed for repeat firings and rapid
turnaround.

        Worden said future single-stage rockets could employ
tri-propellant engine technology developed in the former Soviet Union.
The resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and
then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes.",space

No argument at all with Murphy.  He scared the hell out of me when he came in

that's not considered that crucial by the club.  I can just remember two years

I'm not that concerned.  Those guys have been relatively consistent over the
years and they have no good reasons to decline (no injuries, not old, ...).
I expect them to come through just fine.  It's those guys that have not

Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:)
I forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.
 
As far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who
beat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.
 
I agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that
Lankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make
a perfect throw?
 
I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't
forget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went
from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/
Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant
race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I
will never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading
in the right direction.
 
One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds,
but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the
East), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they
lose.  Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way.

In this single posting of yours, I've seen more ""constructs of imagination""
than in all of the pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news
group.  First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us
about ""the only true God,"" whom you interpret according to your own likes
and dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about
Him myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other
faiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different
way or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission
and progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob
or opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited
every continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.

Sigh.  ""What the Bible teaches""?  Or: ""what the bible teaches according to
Robert Weiss and co.?""  I respect the former, I reject the latter without
the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by
the way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you
being a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a
Christian (following my own image of Him in my heart).

#  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of

The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-
represent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of ""official doctrine""
is obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial
(e.g. ""The Seven Deadly Heresies"" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,
or erroneous at worst (""blacks not to receive the priesthood in this
dispensation"").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable
contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal
interpretations (his book ""Mormon Doctrine"" is oftentimes referred to
as ""McConkie's Bible"" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather
look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!
(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie
was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of
God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted
doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and
speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most
biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the
trash coming from your proverbial pen.  I'm somewhat appalled that I have
allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting...

As I have read this net the last few days, I am continually amazed at the 
pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals.  Especially when it 
comes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer.  As a long time Red Sox
fan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you
with short memories. short lives, or both.  

To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism
from those who only follow 'the hot team'.  This statement is supported based
on the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a 
team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean
years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.  

Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if
Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The
fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans
supported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of 
detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what 
happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly 
not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all,
remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that
far, let alone beat Baltimore.

Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football
and Basketball.  Because of this, one can never say with absolute certainity what
the outcome will be over the course of 162 games.",sport

1- US COMMERCIAL SPACE SALES FLATTEN IN 1993
   The US Department of Commerce projects US commercial space sales 
will remain flat in 1993, with current data showing only a 2 percent 
growth over 1992.  As published in ""US Industrial Outlook 1993"" 
(which was released in January), revenues from the 1993 US space 
business are currently projected to be about $4,890 M. 
   In contrast to previous years when US commercial space sales had 
shown double digits growth rates, this year's projected results are 
driven by the US satellite manufacturing industry, where sales are 
projected to drop from 12 satellites worth $1,300 M in 1992 to 7 
satellites worth $ 670 M in 1993.  The US Industrial Outlook also 
projects U.S. commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year, 
and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to 
$450 M, future sales will be ""adversely affected by the downward 
revision in Department of Defense launch plans.""                           
   Offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries, 
revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to 
increase to $1,900 M, primarily driven by increased revenues from 
broadcast and cable TV networks.  Similarly, remote sensing products 
and sales are projected to increase to $250 M in 1993 (up 15%).

        (r) = revised data for 1992   (e) = estimated data for 1993
   [Commentary: This is the first look at how the US commercial 
space industry is expected to do in 1993.  In general, not a bad 
report -- with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite 
manufacturing area.  There, changes of only a few satellites worth 
$100 M or so apiece can substantially influence the annual 
projection.  If we look forward over several years, this market 
sector should retain strong sales as US firms have been very 
successful in regaining international market share in the satellite 
business. 
   Furthermore, sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in 
the next revision of this data, expected to be released about mid-
year.  Data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales (including 
such items as GPS receivers and portable satellite terminals) 
appears to be missing from the January data set.  DoC usually 
publishes a listing of  ""Space Business Indicators"" in mid-year, and 
the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released 
then.  I expect the revised revenues should easily top $5,000 M, if 
the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the 
numbers, and the year should show about a 10% overall market growth. 
   Looking beyond this year's data, future markets look quite 
promising.  The DoC projects satellite service revenues could top 
$3,000 M by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct 
broadcasting are implemented as planned, and that mobile satellite 
station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15-20 % per year 
through the mid 1990's.  My numbers are somewhat more pessimistic 
for near-term market growth, but I agree the trend should be for 
substantial growth in US commercial space sales over at least the 
next 5-10 years.  (My pessimism is due to more conservative 
assumptions on market capture and growth in LEO communications and 
satellite direct broadcasting services.  I don't believe all of the 
current players in the yet-to-be-born LEO communications satellite 
market and in the yet-to-be-proven direct broadcasting market will 
be financial successes, nor that sales growth will be as explosive 
as currently projected.) 
   It should also be noted this year's DoC data is the first 
release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research 
facilities.  The $60 M shown in the Janurary data is primarily for 
the Spacehab module, planned for launch in April on the Space 
Shuttle, but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first 
sales from the COMET orbital launch and recovery experiment module.] 

2- DELTA WINS TWO KEY LAUNCH CONTRACTS
   McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which builds and markets the Delta 
launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts.  Motorola 
Inc. announced in mid February that it had selected the Delta to 
launch most of the satellites in the 66-satellite Iridium LEO 
communications constellation, and in mid April, McDonnell Douglas 
was awarded the USAF Medium Launch Vehicle III contract. 
   The launch services contract with Motorola for the Iridium 
constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 Iridium 
satellites.  Another 21 satellites have been contracted to be 
launched by Khrunichev Enterprise in Russian on 3 Proton vehicle 
launches.  These 45 satellites planned for the Delta will be 
launched 5 at a time,  providing for at least 9 launches.  
Additional satellites in the Iridium constellation, such as a 
planned on-orbit spares, may also be launched on Delta.  Although 
details of the launch services contract were reported to be 
negotiation, and not yet final. 
   The USAF MLV contract also went to MDC, bidding a variant of 
their Delta II launcher.  This contract is only initially worth $7.5 
million, but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 
launches, encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002.  These 
launches will deploy the next generation of the USAF's Global 
Positioning System Block IIR navigation satellites, plus other 
programs.  First option for to meet the USAF launch options is 
expected to be exercised this year, after which the USAF is expected 
to request launches of up to 6 Deltas per year for at least 6 years.  
Under this contract the USAF can also request ""launch on demand"" 
services from MDC for the 1996-2002 time period, with a launch to 
occur within 40 days of the request. 
    [Commentary:  If these two contracts are fulfilled, they should 
provide an excellent business base for MDC's Delta launch program 
through the turn of the century.  Combined, these two contracts have 
a potential for about 45 launches, worth about $2,200 M to MDC, and 
sustaining a core business base of $300-400 M/year.  Other contracts 
for international and commercial payloads, as well as for NASA 
Medium ELV-class payloads, will add to this business base -- keeping 
MDC as a viable commerical launch company. 
    However, it should be noted there are risk elements in these 
contracts.  Motorola's Iridium LEO communications constellation has 
not yet received a US Federal Communications Commission license for 
operation in the U.S., nor has Motorola lined up all the financing 
and financial partners for the Iridium venture.  Without these 
approvals or financial backing there will be no Iridium launches.  
But, hopefully, these uncertainties will be settled this year. 
   Similarly, the USAF MLV III program has been the target of 
several Congressional actions which have slowed the production of 
the GPS Block IIR satellites and deleted the funding for the MLV III 
program in favor of the USAF NLS/""Spacelifter"" program.  At this 
time, while it appears the MLV III contract will be executed, future 
funding for the MLV III and other USAF commercial launch contracts 
is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy 
reviews.  Some opinions expressed from within the Administration and 
Congress propose cancellation of all ""ELV upgrade"" programs 
(including the MLV programs) in favor of the proposed ""Spacelifter"" 
program.  Such opinions may have some weight in this year's budget 
deliberations, particularly as DoD funds will be more difficult to 
find in the shrinking US Defense budget.] 
 
3- COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING VENTURE GETS DOC ""GO-AHEAD""
   The first commercial license to operate a remote sensing 
satellite was approved in early February by the US Department of 
Commerce's Office of Space Commerce.  A license was granted to 
WorldView Imaging Corporation of Oakland, California to build and 
operate a pair of LEO imaging satellites to provide multi-spectral 
images of the Earth. 
   [Commentary:  There has been little data released on this venture 
by WorldView and the DoC, other than the announcement of the 
operating and construction license.  This was reported to be at the 
request of WorldView.  Most industry speculation identifies this new 
venture as a ""Star Wars"" spinoff, using SDI-type technology to 
provide digital Earth sensing data, and heavily integrated into 
digital GIS databases for remote sensing/GIS users.  Most probable 
customers for this service include exploration geologists, 
agricultural planners, and urban planners.  
   It is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the 
1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act.  The Act, as passed last 
November, provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote 
sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices.  Prior to 
this act, remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to 
all users at the same prices, and private remote sensing ventures 
would have had to sell at the government-set Landsat data prices. 
   There are rumors of several other potential commercial remote 
sensing ventures working their way through the system at different 
stages of development.  I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite 
systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing 
data market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, 
government-sponsored remote sensing systems, smaller market ventures 
such as WorldView and others can exploit market niches and use 
innovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the 
margin.  I predict there may be some very interesting ventures 
appearing in the next year or so.] 
                 
4- INVESTMENT FIRM CALLS GD'S SPACE BIZ ""STILL A GOOD INVESTMENT"" 
   Wall Street investment house Morgan Stanley thinks General 
Dynamic's Space Systems Division could still be a moneymaker, 
despite having failed in the last 3 Atlas launches.  In a recent 
analyst's report Morgan Stanley said ""We are more than ever 
convinced that if the company can return the Atlas to its historical 
95%-plus success rate, this will become a highly profitable, cash-
generating unit.""  Based upon discussions with GD's corporate 
management, Morgan Stanley projects that if the Atlas problems are 
cleared up the unit could see $70 M in earnings per year by 1995 and 
$100 M per year by 2000.  This is based upon GD's projection of 
capturing about 10 Atlas launches per year on the world market. 
   [Commentary:  Three failures in a row of their launch system has 
hurt General Dynamic's Space Systems Division.  Since GD has 
restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses, 
many market pundits have been speculating GD's space business might 
be next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicates GD's Space 
Systems Division has some potential as a moneymaker, despite current 
problems -- if they can get their act together.  Sales are projected 
to be about $560 M in 1993, which will probably generate a loss of 
about $25 M.  If GD can capture their projected share of the space 
launch market, and if they have managed to clean up the reliability 
of their Atlas launchers, then they could generate healthy profits 
from those sales.  But until they demonstrate the Atlas Centaur 
program is back on track, this division will continue to show 
substantial losses. 
   In response to the sell-off rumors, in my opinion, this operation 
is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  
To do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional 
management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm.  
In GD SSD's case, to get the division back on track, the management 
team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with 
the Atlas Centaur, as well as in selling Atlas services.  This would 
indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch 
operations could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince 
customers to buy their launch services.  Optimally, the firm would 
have substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in 
marketing space technology internationally as well.  Candidates for 
this might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockheed, and Martin, and possibly 
McDonnell Douglas and Boeing.  But most of those firms have cash 
flow problems (MDC), have had a substantial business contraction 
(Boeing and MDC), are involved with other launch firms (Lockheed), 
or have taken on substantial debt (Martin).  And coming up with the 
$700-1500 M purchase price for the division is a big chunk of 
change for any company.] 
 
5 - ARIANE PREDICTS DIP IN LAUNCH DEMAND
   Arianespace, the operator of the Ariane launch system, is 
projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990's.  In early 
February, Arianespace released their annual market survey, which 
detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the 
next decade. 
   Over short run, Arianespace expects to retain their dominant 
position and sustain a majority share of the launch market.  Of 54 
international and commercial launches planned through 1995, Ariane 
holds contracts for 31, General Dynamics' Atlas vehicle holds 14 
contracts, McDonnell Douglas' Delta holds 7, and Great Wall's Long 
March vehicle holds 2 launch contracts. 
   Three-quarters of future launch contracts for which Ariane can 
compete are projected to come from communications satellites with 
the remaining 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and 
scientific satellites.  Most of the future telecommunications demand 
growth is predicted to come from the Asia/Pacific region. 
   Arianespace expects the current market consolidation of 
individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will 
continue, with these groups investing in heavier satellites with 
larger communications payloads carrying more transponders. 
Arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications 
satellites should increase by 20 % over today's average level, to 
about 3000 kg in GEO. 
   Demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain 
strong over the next three years, but in the second half of the 
decade, Arianespace predicts demand will decrease.  Arianespace 
bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder 
demand and supply,  particularly as new data compression techniques 
appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing 
or near-term transponders. 
   One of the significant possible changes in the market was 
identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles, including Russian 
launch systems.  But Arianespace predicts that in the long term, 
investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade 
off between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and 
other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities 
and service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. 
   [Commentary:  Ariane releases their market surveys annually, and 
I reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  
Comparing the two surveys, there aren't outstanding differences in 
the numbers.   The most notable change is the consideration of new 
data compression techniques, reducing the demand for new physical 
transponders on orbit.
   I note that in contrast to some predictions, demand for space-
based communications transponders appears to be remain strong. While 
fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the 
established point-to-point telecommunications markets, growing 
demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point-to-
multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space 
transponder demand.  Fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability 
service, but only from established point A to established point B. 
To establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable 
between the points, and while there are improved network solutions, 
installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost 
millions or billions of dollars.  
   For broadcast services where there is not an existing ground 
network structure, satellites still offer the most cost effective 
solution.  And if new services are required into a new region, it is 
cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of 
thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite 
network.  This allows rapid growth of new satellite services, and 
has kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptics is 
growing as well, since as demand grows between the points serviced, 
it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to 
handle the increase in traffic. 
   Since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still 
growing rapidly, satellite market projections remain rosy.  But 
satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes.  Current 
generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of 
on-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 years of service from 
last generation's satellites.  This has cut back some of the launch 
demand, as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite 
launches over longer intervals. 
   And as last note; Arianespace didn't flag it this year, but it 
looks like the space transportation market will be rather over-
supplied by existing launch systems in the near term.  The annual 
commercial launch demand is for about 15-20 medium sized satellites 
per year.  From the supply side, Ariane is capable of launching up 
to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year, Delta is capable of 
about 9-12 per year, Atlas is capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, 
Japan's H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia's Proton capable of 8, and other 
systems such as Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launches per 
year.  That's a lot of capability for a small market. 
   We can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial 
launches.]

6- NTSB INVESTIGATES PEGASUS LAUNCH OVER ABORTED ABORT 
   The 9 Feb Pegasus launch by Orbital Sciences Corporation has 
spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety 
rules.  A valid abort order from a NASA range safety officer to halt 
the mission was overridden and the Pegasus was launched in violation 
of range safety rules.  
   In the last few minutes of the Pegasus launch countdown, one of 
two abort command receivers aboard the Pegasus failed.  Such a failure 
typically scrubs a launch,and a NASA range safety officer at 
Wallops Island, VA issued a mission abort order about a minute 
before the scheduled Pegasus launch.  Somehow this command was 
overridden by the OSC launch team or the message was lost in the 
communications channels, and the Pegasus was launched despite the 
valid abort call. 
   Fortunately, the Pegasus functioned as expected, and the abort 
command receiver was not needed.  But this incident did spark an 
investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed-to 
launch constraint rules, and was not obeyed. 
   Leading the investigation is the National Transportation Safety 
Board (NTSB) with support from NASA, OSC, and the Air Force.  This 
investigation marks the first time NTSB has taken the lead on an 
incident involving a space launch.  According to the NTSB, their 
investigation will take about 6 months, and is primarily looking at 
lines of authority, communications links and safety procedures used 
in the launch. 
  [Commentary: This is the first time that the NTSB has led an 
investigation into a space launch.  Their leadership was requested 
by the Department of Commerce's Office of Commercial Space 
Transportation, who had licensed the commercial launch.  
   At the time of writing this column, some of the initial 
investigations have been concluded, and some of the results are 
starting to leak out into the trade press.  Apparently, 3 or four 
different communications channels were in use during the test. After 
the abort destruct receiver stopped responding, the NASA test 
director and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallops 
Island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch.  
According to the mission rules, this should have stopped the launch. 
Somehow, the OSC test conductor ordered the abort reversed, and the 
NASA communicator on the net relayed that order to the B-52 carrying 
the Pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch.  Differing 
explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed -- with the 
best set being that clear lines of communications and clear 
definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team, and 
understanding of the mission rules were not established before the 
launch.  
   As we see more and more commercial launches, more of these 
procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved.   
This case is interesting because it is the first time the NTSB has 
been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem (as they 
do with commercial aircraft problems).  
   I think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with 
procedures and communications, and will be cleared up with issuance 
of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how 
specific lines of authority should be delineated.] 

7- ANOTHER PEGASUS COMPETITOR IS ANNOUNCED
   Tsniimach Enterprise in Russia announced it is marketing a new 
small space launch system, based upon converted ICBM components.  
Two versions of the launcher are being marketed: the ""Aerokosmos"" 
winged vehicle launched like the OSC Pegasus, and the ""Severkosmos"", 
launched from a mobile ground transporter.  The Aerokosmos is 
projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to 
an 800 km circular orbit, and the Severkosmos to be capable of 430 
kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km.  Also proposed to be used 
with these launch systems is a LEO data relay system called 
'Sineva'.  Tsniimach Enterprise is described as a ex-military 
establishment, focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of 
spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the 
Buran shuttle system,  They are located near the NPO Energia 
facility in Kaliningrad, outside of Moscow. 
   [Commentary: There's very little released information on this new 
venture.  My suspicion is it is another Russian enterprise looking 
for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in-house 
knowledge of ex-Soviet launch systems.  It adds to the list of numerous 
commercial space startups announced from the ex-Soviet Union. 
   This one's a little different in that they are offering variants 
of ex-Soviet ICBMs, but I can't identify any key customers being 
targeted or substantial financial backing.]

8- GEORGIA LAUNCH SITE DROPPED FROM PLANNING
   In late January, Georgia Tech Research Institute released the 
results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial 
rocket launching site in Camden County, Georgia at the old Kingsland 
Missile Test Launching Site on the Atlantic coast.  The preliminary 
study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch 
site, stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected 
low investment returns, plus environmental and other geographic 
considerations.  However, the report did say the site might be ideal 
for other aerospace uses, and recommended other potential uses. 
   [Commentary:  This should put the nails in the coffin of the 
Kingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other sites are still 
proceeding with commercial launch site development plans, Kingsland 
found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant, and if 
substantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expected 
returns were too low to justify the cost of development.  
   This might point out some key discriminators in judging the 
feasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:
  - Is there an identified key customer to provide core usage 
sufficient to recover setup costs?
  - Is there a market advantage of using the site?
  - Can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site?
  - Can financing be found at low enough cost to support the 
investment?  
   Other commercial launch site ventures -- including those at 
Woomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sands, Alabama Off-Shore 
Platform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judged against 
these criteria.  In my opinion, some of these ventures are flying 
on hope and speculation, and not on sound financial grounds.]

9- SPAIN'S CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCEEDING
   In one of his last official acts, former President Bush 
authorized space technology transfer for several joint space 
ventures between US and other firms.  One of these was a proposed 
use of US technology by Spain to build a small booster.  With that 
regulatory impediment removed, the 3-stage Capricornia launch 
vehicle will start development later this year, planning for a first 
launch in the 1995/96 time period.  The Capricornia is described as 
a small 3-stage all solid booster designed to put 250-500 Kg into 
LEO.  Several launch sites are being examined for the system, 
including 2 on the Iberian peninsula and 1 on the Canary Islands.  
Originated by INTA in Spain, the project reports it has $ 30 M in 
development funding, and will use technology from Argentina's Condor 
launch vehicle as well as from the US. 
   [Commentary:  Several firms have identified a market opportunity 
in providing a small launcher for the European market.  Small 
payloads from European firms or organizations currently use either 
Ariane piggyback launches or the US/Italian Scout launcher.  
However, Ariane piggyback opportunities are limited, and the Scout 
program is being phased out (accompanied by some disarray in the 
Italian government and space industry regarding any follow-on 
system).  
   This has left an apparent niche for a new European small launch 
system.  Surprisingly enough, ESA has not supported development of 
such a system within the current space funding structure.  Studies 
have been performed by British Aerospace, Aerospatiale, Deutsche 
Aerospace, and Italian organizations, but with the exception of the 
Swedish/PacAstro system (reported below), I have not been able to 
find any other European development work with even a rumor of 
funding for hardware. 
   Also of interest is the linking of the Capricornia to the 
Argentinian Condor launcher.  There have been some interesting 
rumors surfacing out of Argentina over the past year about a space 
launcher/IRBM program funded under the military junta which ruled 
the country in the 1970's and early 1980's. 
   What is known is in Feb 1992, the Argentinian Air Force formally 
transferred control of the Condor 2 missile program to the new 
civilian Argentinian national space agency (Comison Nacional de 
Atividades Espaciales - CNAE).  The Condor 2 program was described 
as originating in 1983, expanding upon the smaller Condor 1 rocket 
program in collaboration with Egypt and with support of German 
firms.  The Condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by Iraq 
in the mid-1980's.  Fairly large solid rocket motors were built and 
tested, but Argentinan development of a suitable guidance package 
lagged that of the propulsion system. 
   It should be noted CNAE is planning to launch its first 
scientific satellite in late 1994.  The US$ 9 M, 181 Kg, SAC-B 
satellite will study the Earth's upper atmosphere and includes 
cooperative experiments from Italy and the US. No launch vehicle has 
yet been selected, but OSC's Pegasus and the Russian Burlak Air 
launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this 
contract.] 

10- PACASTRO SIGNS LAUNCH RESERVATION WITH SWEDISH SPACE CORP
   PacAstro, a small launch firm in Herndon, Virginia announced in 
late February it had received a $6 M launch reservation contract 
from the Swedish Space Corp to launch a satellite on PacAstro's PA-2 
launch vehicle.   This will be performed as part of the Polar 
Satellite Service (PSS), a joint Norwegian Space Center/ Swedish 
Space Corp. program to upgrade the Andoya Rocket Range in Norway and 
offering small satellite launches into the polar regions.  According 
to PacAstro, PSS is also performing an $8 M upgrade of the Andoya 
launch facilities, including a new integration facility and a fully-
enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like 
the PacAstro PA-2.  PacAstro has been chosen as ""the main 
alternative rocket supplier"" for the small satellite launch service 
to be offered by PSS from Andoya.  The date of the launch of the 
Swedish satellite was not specified. 
   [Commentary:  PacAstro has been trying to line up customers and 
funding for their launch vehicle for some time now.  The PA-2 is a 
small, two stage rocket fueled by RP-1 and Liquid Oxygen.  From 
PacAstro's literature, the engines designed for the PA-series 
rockets are built of ""off the shelf"" components based upon the Lunar 
MOdule Descent Engines built by TRW, and are capable of putting a 
225 Kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit.  
   PacAstro is trying to arrange construction financing for its 
first three PA-2 vehicles, with a first launch planned for 1995, and 
2 orbital launches planned for 1996.  My records show PacAstro hired 
TRW to provide marketing support and systems design,  with primary 
engineering to be done by AeroAstro, a small satellite builder 
closely associated with PacAstro (headquartered in the same 
building).  The Swedish Space Corporation would supply engineering, 
launch operations, vehicle subsystems, and marketing support. 
Sumitomo Corp. of Tokyo, is a first round investor and sits on the 
board of directors.  
   PacAstro has gotten a first round financial package of at least 
$550 K  (Some sources place this of high as $1 M), but has been 
searching for about a year for the additional $20-30 M needed to 
design, build and launch their first set of vehicles. 
   The launch reservation from SSC can possibly be used to help 
bring some investors on board, but by my estimate, they will need 
much more than the single $6 M sale to put their venture into real 
hardware.] 

11- CHINA AND TAIWAN JOINT SATELLITE VENTURE REPORTED
    In early March, it was reported a joint satellite communications 
venture between a Taiwanese and mainland Chinese was in the works.  
As reported in the Taipei press, China Development Corp. (CDC), 
headquartered in Taiwam and with links to the ruling Nationalist 
Party, is planning to set up a joint venture in Hong Kong with China 
Great Wall Industry Corp. with the objective of launching a regional 
communications satellite. CDC would cover about 10% of the satellite 
system cost (US $10 M) in exchange for rights to 10% of the 
satellite's communications channels.  
   [Commentary:  This announcement came close on the heels of the 
release of Taiwanese plans for space development (released in mid 
January).   In those plans, the National Space Program Office of 
Taiwan will launch 3 satellites, starting with ROCSAT-1, a 400 Kg 
scientific spacecraft, planned for launch in 1997.  Two additional 
satellites are planned, both communications satellites.   TRW has 
been helping Taiwan plan this program, budgeted at T$13.6 B (US $530 
M) through 2006.  
   I haven't been able to establish any relationship between this 
venture and those of the NSPOT, but there might be a connection.  
While Taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures, the 
current Taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two 
separate sastellite ventures. 
   The reported name for the Tiawanese/Chinese system is ""Asiasat-
2"", but I don't thinks this has any relationship with the existing 
Hong Kong-based ""Asiasat"" program involving Chinese, Hong Kong, and 
other Asian investors, other than using it as an organizational 
model.  There are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing 
venture -- it could provide excellent first-hand experience to 
Taiwan for a very low cost, which then can be used in later 
satellite ventures.  But there are internal political issues between 
Taiwanese and Chinese ventures, but putting any joint venture 
through a  Hong Kong intermediary corporation might allow it to 
proceed. 
   In any case, the East Asian satellite market is lighting up with 
substantially growth projected in space services and revenues.  This 
is just another indicator to add to the list.] 

12- SOUTH KOREA ANNOUNCES NATIONAL MOVE INTO SPACE TECHNOLOGIES
   South Korea's Trade, Industry and Resources Ministry recently 
announced plans to invest US$22 B in research and development and 
another US$17 B into manufacturing and research facilities for 
advanced aerospace technologies.  Space technologies have been 
specifically targeted as part of this program, beginning with 
manufacture and launch of an advanced multi-purpose satellite by 
1997.  The objective of this investment is to raise South Korea's 
aerospace technology to the level of the world's top 10 countries by 
2000.                                 
   [Commentary: South Korea has been quietly working to develop its 
national aerospace industry, specifically including space 
activities. I'm noting this as a flag that potential new players are 
coming into the commercial space market. 
   As part of their national effort, 2 national telecommunications 
satellites for Korea Telecom will be launched in April and Oct 1995 
on Delta. Designated Koreasat 1 and 2, the platforms will provide 
television and telephone service throughout the Korean Peninsula, 
southwestern Japan and portions of China bordering North Korea. 
   South Korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on 
Ariane in Aug 1992, called Uribyol-1 (Our Star) and costing about US 
$8.8 M.  Uribyol-2 is planned for piggyback launch in October of 
this year, again on Ariane, and will be entirely ""made in Korea.""  
Uribyol-3, projected for a 1995 launch, will be an environment-
monitoring micro-satellite. 
   This satellite may be the precursor to a series of small Earth 
observation satellites,  The KEOS (Korean Earth Observation System) 
project, which has been submitted for approval to the South Korean 
government, would use two or three 300-kg spacecraft equipped with 
optical and microwave sensors.
   South Korean press reports claim there is also a parallel 
military effort to establish the capabilities for building and 
launching small military satellites by 2001.  Supposedly a 
government panel had been established to oversee such an effort, 
funded at US $ 500 M between 1993 and 2001, in anticipation of an  
expected pullout of U.S. intelligence-gathering systems from the 
Korean peninsula.       
   In conjunction with all of these reported efforts, South Korean 
is also pursuing production work either as off-sets to existing 
aerospace technology contracts (for example, McDonnell Douglas is 
offsetting production of some Delta parts to South Korean firms as 
part of the Koreasat launch contracts), or for production of 
consumer space items (among other products, South Korea exports 
satellite receiver television setups to Japan, and Samsung has 
announced teaming for production of OSC's Orbcomm user terminals.).  
   This looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies.  
Considering that East Asia is currently the fastest growing sector 
for commercial space services (primarily for telecommunications), a 
South Korean push into space technologies may change the composition 
of commercial space market there over the next decade.] 

13- SPACE TECHNOLOGY INDEXES THROUGH MARCH
   As announced in the last CSN/STI, each issue will give the 
results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and 
investments.  The table below summarizes results to the end of 
March.  The Space Technology Index did quite a bit better than the 
market as a whole, as represented by the S&P 500 index.  Since 90+% 
of the values included in the index are US firms, this represents a 
general increase in the market value of space-related firms.  The 
increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 -- which 
is a very promising sign, although future months may reverse this 
trend. The Commercial Space Technology Index has also done quite 
well, but the Pure Play portfolio -- consisting of stocks of firms 
which are pure plays in space technologies -- has also surpassed its 
results in all of 1993.  We'll keep an eye on these ....

Of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented.
Just as a penny saved is a penny earned.  Enough with the cliches.
My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to
their potential, they won't need much offensive support.
I realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust.
There is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three other
pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first
or second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the
mound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most 
runs wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage
(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low 
scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many 
low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.
On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,
I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.
They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their
opponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows that
you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard.
All I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers
like the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong.

"Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the
_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television
station, KTVB Channel 7.

Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 4.

Friday, April 16, 1993 was the fourth day of the trial.

Synopsis: Defense attorney Gerry Spence cross-examined agent
Cooper under repeated objections from prosecutor Ronald
Howen.  Spence moved for a mistrial but was denied.

The day was marked by a caustic cross-examination of Deputy
Marshal Larry Cooper by defense attorney Gerry Spence.  Although
Spence has not explicitly stated so, one angle of his stategy
must involve destroying the credibility of agent Cooper.  Cooper is
the government's only eyewitness to the death of agent Degan.
Spence attacked Cooper's credibility by pointing out discrepancies
between Cooper's statements last September and those made in court.
Cooper conceded that, ""You have all these things compressed into
a few seconds...It's difficult to remember what went on first.""

Cooper acknowledged that he carried a ""9mm Colt Commando submachine
gun with a silenced barrel."" [I thought a Colt Commando was a revolver!]
Cooper continued by stating that the federal agents had no specific
plans to use the weapon when they started to kill Weaver's dog.

When Spence asked how seven cartridges could be fired by Degan's
M-16 rifle when Degan was apparently dead, Cooper could not say for
sure that Degan did not return fire before going down.

Spence continued by asking with how many agents (and to what extent)
had Cooper discussed last August's events, Cooper responded, ""If
you're implying that we got our story together, you're wrong,
counselor.""  Spence continued to advance the defense's version of
the events: Namely, that a marshal had started the shooting by
killing the Weaver's dog.  Cooper disagreed.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald Howen repeatedly objected to Spence's
virulent cross-examination of agent Cooper, arguing that the questions
were repetitive and Spence was wasting time.  Howen also complained 
that Spence was improperly using a cross-examination to advance the
defense's version of the events.  U.S. District Judge Edward Lodge
sustained many of the objections; however, both lawyers persisted
until Judge Lodge had the jury leave the room and proceded to
admonish both attorneys.  ""I'm not going to play games with either
counsel.  This has been a personality problem from day 1, so start
acting like professionals.""

Spence told the judge that, ""When all the evidence is in, we'll see
that ... his [agent Larry Cooper] testimony is not credible, that
he was panicked and cannot remember the sequence of events."" 
Spence continued, ""We're going to find...that there is a very unlikely
similarity - almost as if it had come out of a cookie cutter - between
the testimony of Mr. Cooper and the other witnesses.""

Spence then moved for a mistrial on the grounds that Howen's repeated
objections would prevent a fair trial, ""We can't have a fair trial if the
jury believes I'm some sort of charlatan, if the jury believes I'm
bending the rules or engaging in some delaying tactic or that I'm
violating court orders.""

Judge Lodge called the notion that his repeated sustainings of Howen's
objections had somehow prejudiced the jury was ""preposterous"" and
denied the motion for a mistrial.  Lodge did tell Howen to restrict
his comments when objecting.

The trial resumed with the prosecution calling FBI Special Agent Greg
Rampton.  The prosecution's purpose was simply to introduce five
weapons found in the cabin as evidence: However, the defense seized
on the opportunity to further address Cooper's credibility.

Defense attorney Ellison Matthews (Harris' other attorney) questioned
Rampton about the dog.  Rampton stated that there were no specific
plans to kill the Weaver's dog without being detected.  Matthews then
had Rampton read  a Septtember 15, 1992 transcript in which Rampton
had said that Cooper had said that the purpose of the silenced weapon
was to kill the dog without being detected, if the dog chased them.
Rampton then acknowledged that he believed that Cooper had said that,
but he could not remember when.  He then stated that, ""I did not conduct
the primary interview with Deputy Cooper, but I have had conversations
with him since the interview was conducted.""",politics
"I HATE long postings, but this turned out to be rather lengthy....


Overall Crime rate:
It fell....just like that...

Acquiring weapons in Norway:
You can buy (almost) all kinds of weapons in Norway, BUT you must have a 
permit, and a good reason to get the permit....
If I would like to have a handgun, i would have to get an gun-licence from 
the police and to be a member of a gun-club.
The police would check my criminal records for any SERIOUS crimes and/or
records of SERIOUS mental diseases.
Now, if a got my licence, I would have to be an active member of the gun
-club for 6 months BEFORE I could collect my gun.
It's a little like getting a drivers licence isn't it ???
You have to prove that you CAN drive before you are allowed to...

Use of guns in crimes (in Norway):
Some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners 'arms'
for a long time, but these are rather the exeption.
Most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes, and mostly short 
time befor the crime.

Use of knives:
It IS allowed to cary knifes in public, but not in your belt or 'open'.
You (Americans) think it's ok to have a gun, but not to carry it open
in public -rigth ??

Scandinavians ARE 'aggressive':
We northeners are not as hot-livered as southeners, but when we decide
to take action we DO.
Ask ANY historian or millitary with an knowledge of europe....
(Or ask any German who served in Norway in WW2.....)

Individual vs masses:
Yes the individual is more important than the masses, but only to some
extent....
Your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses ??
What happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of 
all the others ??


The issue:
I believe the issue is GUNS, and gun-legislation.
We shouldn't mix weapons and items that can serve as one....
IF i lived in Amerika I would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in HOME.
But should it have to be like that ??
Do you think it's wise to sell guns like candy (some states do...) ??
If you believe it's smart/neccacery to have drivers-licence WHY do you think
it should be free to buy guns ??

Disclaim-her:
I'm not a pacifist or anti gun. 
I would defend my home, loved ones and country, but I don't view guns as
neccities or toys.
I HAVE done army service, and HAVE used a variaty of weapons, but wouldn't
want to have one for self defence or because they 'feel good'....

RKBA archive: general information and anonymous ftp instructions.

The moderator of the firearms-politics mailing list, Karl Kleinpaste,
has agreed to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for RKBA
related information.  This directory can be used for things like
articles by Kates, Wright, Tonso, Levinson, Supreme Court Decisions,
the RIA vs US decision, copies of legislation, and so on.  It's not
meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here.

So, in the future if you're looking for something check there first
and then ask here.

Instructions:

Short version for techies:

The site is godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu.  Place contributions into the
directory /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba.  The ftp commands
get, put, mget, or mput should work.  Give the command ""type binary""
to be sure files are transferred correctly.  Your files will be moved
to the rkba directory.  To get a file use the commands get or mget.

I will maintain an index which you should get first to check if
the file you want to read or write already is archived.

Long version for non-techies:

In order for you to use this archive your computer must be on
the Internet.  To connect to the archive site run the command:

	ftp godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu

If that doesn't work you cannot use this archive.  If the ftp
command is successful you'll get this prompt asking you for a
login:
	Name (godiva.nectar.cs.cmu.edu:lvc):

Instead of lvc your initials will appear.  Answer this prompt with:

	ftp

Next you'll get this prompt asking your for your e-mail address:

	Guest login ok, send e-mail address as password:

I would enter:

	l.v.cipriani@att.com

You'll enter your own e-mail address.  You'll get these lines
or similar as output:

	Remote system is UNIX.
	Using binary mode to transfer files.

Next, the command prompt is printed:

	ftp> 

If you do not get the line ""Using binary mode to transfer files.""
Run the command:

	type binary

Now you're logged in to the archive machine.  There are many
directories on this machine  but the two you are concerned with are

	/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba
and
	/usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming

There are subdirectories to the rkba directory, those are discussed below.

When you login to the system your directory is /usr0/anon.  To retreive
files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command:

	cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/rkba
or
	cd pub/firearms/politics/rkba

To submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with
the command:

	cd /usr0/anon/pub/firearms/politics/incoming
or
	cd pub/firearms/politics/incoming

Once you do this you'll get another ftp> prompt asking you to enter
another command.

To find the names of the existing files in the directory you are
in run the command:

	ls -l

This will produce something like:

total 6021
-r--r--r--  1 karl          6932 Jun 16  1992 DMN_Gratia_CCP
-r--r--r--  1 karl         69149 Apr  5 19:20 INDEX
-r--r--r--  1 karl         18965 Jun 16  1992 Knox_AW_lies
-r--r--r--  1 karl         10930 Apr 30  1992 S361

-r--r--r--  1 karl         36079 Aug  4  1992 aclu
... and so on ...

Each line corresponds to one file.  Reading right to left, the fields
are the file name, the last modification date of the file, the size of
the file in bytes, and some permission fields which you do not need
to be concerned with.

To get a file run the command ""get"" followed by the name of the file
you want, for example:

	get INDEX
or
	get noduty

After the file is transfered to your machine a message like this:

	Transfer complete.
	19580 bytes received in 5 seconds (4 Kbytes/s)

You can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive.
You can use the mget command to retreive multiple files.  If the
file you want is in a subdirectory, for example, congress/103rd/HR1025
you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first
and then retrieve it:

	cd congress/103rd
	get HR1025

Once you're finished you can log off with the command:

	quit

If you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little
different.  First of all you should find out if the file already
exists, so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above
and look it over to make sure you wouldn't repeat an entry.  The
index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba
directory.  For example:

----------------------------------------------------------------------
File: whitemanslaw

White Man's Law by William R. Tonso, from the December 1985
Reason magazine
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Once you've determined you won't be duplicating an entry, login
and change to the incoming directory command (see above).  Once
you are in the incoming directory use the command:

	put file_name

In this case:

	put whitemanslaw

Again there'll be a ""Transfer complete, so many bytes transfered
in so many seconds"" message.  Now your file is on the archive
machine.

Another thing to watch out for is duplicate file /names/.  Be sure
there isn't a file in the incoming directory that is called the same
as the file you want to write.  If you use the same name you'll
overwrite the previous file [or you'll get an error message].

Your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a
file by the same name in the rkba directory.

Once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for
the INDEX file and I will add it to the file.

If you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute
a file email the file to me and I'll take care of the rest.

If you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed, so
be sure to let me know first.

If you have any questions feel free to ask me.

"Jesus:




Black and white.  A spade is a spade.  There is no hidden
agenda behind this, so stop trying to look for one.   It is an
easy and as straight forward as it reads.

Kent, I am not accusing you of evil things.  Jesus is accusing you.
And it is not only you that He is accusing.  He is accusing everyone.
Me, you and everyone in the world is guilty.  Whether one
sees the light or does not seen the light has nothing to do with 
whether we do evil things.  We do them regardless.  

Jesus uses the word ""men"".  I am included.  Jesus is not soloing you out.
Jesus is making a general statement about out the sad state of man.
Christians are not immuned from doing evil things.  A Christian 
is just a person in whom the Holy Spirit indwells.  A Christian 
can see the evil he is doing--because his evil has been brought
out into the light.  Jesus is not saying that just because evil has been
exposed, that the Christian will stop doing evil.  If you haven't
seen Jesus's light, your evil deeds simply haven't been
exposed to the His light.  You may shed some light on your
own.  Your human spirit shines at perhaps 1 candela.  But the
Holy Spirit shines at a Megacandela.  The Holy Spirit can
shine light into places inside us where we didn't even know
existed. 

So do you see Jesus's point?  Christians are not perfect.  Nonchristians
are not perfect.  Nonchristians do not want to come into the
Light of Jesus because they will see all the problems in their lives,
and they will not like the sight.  It is an ugly thing to see how far
we have fallen from Jesus's perspective.  Do you think you want to
know how really ignorant you are?  Do you think Brian Kendig wants
to know?  Do you think I want to know?  Ego verses the truth,
which do you choose?


And I watched Koresh too, an imposter who thought he saw the light, 
who made sure that the 19 children burned to death, sadly, as part
of his delusion.  It is even sadder that the people who
died with him chose to die with them, and that ignorance was
their downfall to death. 

And Kent, don't you bury yourself underneath a rock with an
excuse like bringing up Koresh--as if Koresh actually had truth in him.
David Koresh was no light and no excuse for
you to stay away from the real Jesus Christ.  David Koresh, who
claimed to be Jesus, was a fraud.  It was obvious.  David Koresh
was born in America. Jesus was born in Bethlehem.  Koresh wasn't
even a good imposter having missed an obvious point as that.

Jesus warned of such imposters in the end-times.  David
Koresh wasn't anything new to Jesus.  Jesus told us to be
aware of imposters 2000 years ago.  

So the next time an imposter makes a scene and claims to
be Jesus.  Ask the obvious.  Where were you born?  Was your
mother's name Mary?  If the Branch Davidians asked that
simple question, they would have labeled Koresh a liar
right from the start.  The wouldn't have followed Koresh.
They wouldn't have died.  But look what happened.  Their
ignorance cost them their lives.  Their choice to be ignorant
cost them a lot.

Kent, since you studied the Bible under Lutheranism, do you
not remember what tactic Satan used to try to tempt Jesus?  
Did not Satan quote the Bible out of context?  Do you
remember what tactic the serpent of Genesis used to tempt
Eve?  Did he not misquote God?  What Satan used on Eve and succeeded, 
was the same ploy he tried on Jesus.  But in Jesus's case,
Jesus rebuked Satan back with the Bible _in_ context.  It
didn't work with Jesus.  

Does what Satan did to Eve in the Garden and what Satan
tried to do with Jesus in the desert remind you of what
Koresh did to his followers?  Who did Koresh emulate?
Who was Koresh's teacher?  Koresh did to his followers what
Satan did to Eve.  Did not Koresh kill his followersr?  Did
not Satan cause Adam and Eve to die as well?  Did not
the cult followers believe Koresh even though they knew
the real Christ was born in Bethlehem?   Did not Eve
choose to eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and
evil despite knowing that it would cause her death?  God
held them all responsible--deceiver and the rebeller.  None 
of them had an excuse.  ",religion
"""Space Station Redesign Leader Says Cost Goal May Be
Impossible""

Today (4/6) the Washington Post ran an article with the
headline shown above. The article starts with ""A leader
of the NASA team in charge of redesigning the planned
space station said yesterday the job is tough and may
be impossible."" O'Connor is quoted saying whether it is
possible to cut costs that much and still provide for
meaningful research ""is a real question for me.""
O'Connor said ""everything is fair game,"" including
""dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the
aerospace industry, chopping management of the space
station program at some NASA facilities around the
country, working closely with the Russian space station
Mir, and using unmanned Titan rockets to supplement the
manned space shuttle fleet.""

O'Connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options
so far, and they are sorting the serious candidates
into three categories based on cost.

The Post says O'Connor described the design derived
from the current SSF as a high cost option (I believe
Kathy Sawyer, the Post writer, got confused here. I
listened in on part of O'Connor's briefing to the press
on Monday, and in one part of the briefing O'Connor
talked about how the White House wants three options,
sorted by cost [low, medium, and high]. In another part
of the briefing, he discussed the three teams he has
formed to look at three options [SSF derivative @ LaRC,
modular buildup with Bus-1 @ MSFC, and Single Launch
Core [""wingless Orbiter""] @ JSC. Later, in response to
a reporters question, I thought I heard O'Connor say
the option based on a SSF redesign was a ""moderate""
cost option, in between low & high cost options. Not
the ""high cost"" option as Sawyer wrote).

The article goes on to describe the other two options
as ""one features modules that could gradually be fitted
together in orbit, similar to the Russian Mir. The
other is a core facility that could be deposited in
orbit in a single launch, like Skylab. That option
would use existing hardware from the space shuttle -
the fuselage, for example, in its basic structure.""",space

Very well put.  And, in the case of someone who calls himself a Christian
brother yet continues in his sin (and claims that his sin is not a sin at 
all, but perfectly acceptable), what should be done?  Should Christians 
just ignore a sinful lifestyle in order to not offend the person?  By 
reaffirming that the lifestyle is sinful according to the Bible, are 
they using ""a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus""? 

Frankly, I find the occurance of a homosexual Christian attempting to 
pass himself off as a 'straight' Christian in order to have other 
Christians accept his chastisement better a *lot* more serious than 
people reaffirming that the Bible teaches homosexuality is a sin.  ",religion

True, but that is exactly the ""problem"": the Mormon extermination order

individuals like Robert Weiss (who could have been Gov. Boggs' Lieutenant;
he would have fitted right in, drewling et al), and seems a modern-day
occurrence, based on results (slander, persecution, misrepresentation,
lies, denying Mormons representation in their own user group, etc. etc.

In intent and purpose, what really has changed?

#The situation is not entirely different today.  Many irrational feelings
#and beliefs are justified through religion.  I don't think most of them
#are started because of religion, but religion certainly helps justify and
#perpetuate prejudices and practices by providing a neat justification
#which discourages critical thought.

True, as evidenced by numerous examples, as I am sure you're aware.

#>In any regard, Mormon history alone indicates that secular authorities (and
#>I don't even discuss how Uthan's were suckered into allowing part of their
#>lands in becoming nerve-gas and atomic bomb testing grounds...) is far from
#>being trusted or righteous.  Have things really changed for the better?  I
#>may be a born cynic, but I have NO reason whatsoever that such has been the
#>case. In the early 1980s, I believe, the late President Kimball (lds church
#>leader) strongly protested federal attempts to locate the MX-""Peace Keeper""
#>missile maze from being built in Utah (yet another ""inspired"" decision from
#secular authorities).  Fortunately, his opposition was influential enough
#for the feds to back off.
#
#Do you mean that the ""secular authorities"" are some continuous group of
#people with the common and uninterrupted goal of harrassing/eradicating the
#Mormons?  Do you honestly believe that the main reason for using Utah for
#nuclear testing etc.. was to ""get them thar Mormons""?  And what about the
#majority of Uthan's who aren't Mormons?  You seem to be searching for enemy
 ^^^^^^^^
(Correction: the majority of Utahn's ARE Mormon (60-70% I believe, up to a
 100% in many cities and settlements throughout the Western states.)

#conspiracies.  It is paranoid to believe that everything that affects you
#badly must have been done primarily for that purpose.

What I mean is that secular authorities are to be watched, as we believe
that Satan has been given some power and dominion over the earth to divert
truth, judgment, and justice.  In addition, we believe that the adversary
has power to influence the unjust and idolatrous (greed for money would be
a good example) in order to bring about persecution, war, oppression, and
evil combinations.  As an intelligent being, don't you suppose that the
destroyer would yield his influence foremost on those with political power?

As far as Utah is concerned, what I pointed out were some horrible examples
of environmental nightmares imposed upon by secular authorities, which have
brought death, disease, (i.e. the ""downwinders"") and environmental contami-
nation.  I am hardly ""paranoid,"" I am just not ""expecting"" too much from a
secular government that may not share our values and faith, and which indeed
(as Gov. Boggs et al.) may be out to harm and destroy us.  As a matter of
fact, prophecies in my church indicate that in future years, (global)
persecution against Mormons will so increase in intensity and scope, that
(paraphrasing) ""all those who wish to escape persecution and murder must
flee to Zion.""  Zion (the ""pure in heart"") will be re-established in those
days, and it AIN'T our current secular authorities who will rule over it...

#>...  David Koresh did NOT pose a great
#>threat to the federal authorities or the security of this nation, and with
#>John, I too wonder who or what's next...
#
#I personally feel that we should try to stop anyone who is a threat to the
#life of even one person.  Sure, he did not pose a threat to the security of
#this nation.  But he did pose a threat to the lives of his followers.  That
#much is definite.

Hmmm.  ""definite"" by whom?  --Until such has been established beyond reason-
able doubt, this alleged ""threat"" may have been less than the ""threat""
imposed upon him and his followers by the BATF and FBI...

#>Who killed who?  What constitutional right did the ATF officers have to
#>invade upon private land and to force themselves into the compound?
#>What REALLY caused the ""murder"" of the little children?  Could it be that
#>the ATF/FBI presence has any bearing upon the events?  How would you
#>interpret the Mt. Masada events?  --Blame the Jews?  (What the heck did
#>the Romans do there anyway?  What business did the ATF/FBI has in Waco,
#>Texas???)  The Branch Davidians NEVER posed any threat to society.
#
#This is like asking who REALLY caused the deaths of the Israeli Olympic
#team in 1976?  In that case, the police botched the job as well.  But to
#lay a heavier burden on them than the terrorists would be a terrible
#mistake.  I think the same sort of reasoning applies in this case.
#Certainly, if David Koresh chose any peaceful option, the ATF and FBI
#would have complied.  The responsibility is more his than the authorities.

Come now, at issue is in how much the authorities escalated an otherwise
peaceful stand-off: ""let's get it over with, and ""force"" David Koresh to
come out???""  --By gassing them???  Were they naive, or what?  They played
right into the hands of an apocalyptic-thinking individual (he had prepared
his people for this eventuality for years), and not *one* firetruck or plan
was in place to deal with this scenario???  I feel that the authorities
had ""some"" responsibility to protect their own citizens, even if they were
religious zealots, and guilty of ... not paying a $200 gun license???
(Has the BATF become an extension of the local tax-collectors?)

#>David Koresh, no doubt, will be described as the ""evil"" guy (by the
#>executioners), while the actions of all those ""valiant and brave"" officers
#
#Characterizing the ATF/FBI as executioners is inaccurate and unfair.  In
#order to be an executioner, the least one must have done is have the intent
#to kill.

Que?? --Intrusion into private property with semi's, loaded with life
ammunition, isn't that implicit ""intent (or at least ""prepared"") to kill""?
I ask you, would the BATF warrant stand up in a civil court of justice?
I do not mind if criminals (such as dangerous drug lords) are brought to
justice, but escalating events to the point of allowing to, if not compli-
city with, the destruction of a people?

PLANETARY PROBES - HISTORICAL MISSIONS

    This section was lightly adapted from an original posting by Larry Klaes
    (klaes@verga.enet.dec.com), mostly minor formatting changes. Matthew
    Wiener (weemba@libra.wistar.upenn.edu) contributed the section on
    Voyager, and the section on Sakigake was obtained from ISAS material

US PLANETARY MISSIONS


    MARINER (VENUS, MARS, & MERCURY FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)

    MARINER 1, the first U.S. attempt to send a spacecraft to Venus, failed
    minutes after launch in 1962. The guidance instructions from the ground
    stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna, so the
    onboard computer took control. However, there turned out to be a bug in
    the guidance software, and the rocket promptly went off course, so the
    Range Safety Officer destroyed it. Although the bug is sometimes claimed
    to have been an incorrect FORTRAN DO statement, it was actually a
    transcription error in which the bar (indicating smoothing) was omitted
    from the expression ""R-dot-bar sub n"" (nth smoothed value of derivative
    of radius). This error led the software to treat normal minor variations
    of velocity as if they were serious, leading to incorrect compensation.

    MARINER 2 became the first successful probe to flyby Venus in December
    of 1962, and it returned information which confirmed that Venus is a
    very hot (800 degrees Fahrenheit, now revised to 900 degrees F.) world
    with a cloud-covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide
    (sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978).

    MARINER 3, launched on November 5, 1964, was lost when its protective
    shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary
    space. Unable to collect the Sun's energy for power from its solar
    panels, the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in
    solar orbit. It was intended for a Mars flyby with MARINER 4.

    MARINER 4, the sister probe to MARINER 3, did reach Mars in 1965 and
    took the first close-up images of the Martian surface (22 in all) as it
    flew by the planet. The probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere
    much thinner than previously thought. Many scientists concluded from
    this preliminary scan that Mars was a ""dead"" world in both the
    geological and biological sense.

    MARINER 5 was sent to Venus in 1967. It reconfirmed the data on that
    planet collected five years earlier by MARINER 2, plus the information
    that Venus' atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times
    that of Earth's, or the equivalent of being 3,300 feet under the surface
    of an ocean.

    MARINER 6 and 7 were sent to Mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work
    done by MARINER 4 four years earlier. However, they failed to take away
    the concept of Mars as a ""dead"" planet, first made from the basic
    measurements of MARINER 4.

    MARINER 8 ended up in the Atlantic Ocean in 1971 when the rocket
    launcher autopilot failed.

    MARINER 9, the sister probe to MARINER 8, became the first craft to
    orbit Mars in 1971. It returned information on the Red Planet that no
    other probe had done before, revealing huge volcanoes on the Martian
    surface, as well as giant canyon systems, and evidence that water once
    flowed across the planet. The probe also took the first detailed closeup
    images of Mars' two small moons, Phobos and Deimos.

    MARINER 10 used Venus as a gravity assist to Mercury in 1974. The probe
    did return the first close-up images of the Venusian atmosphere in
    ultraviolet, revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover,
    plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four
    Earth days. MARINER 10 eventually made three flybys of Mercury from 1974
    to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas. The probe revealed
    Mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than
    thought. This would seem to indicate that Mercury has an iron core which
    makes up 75 percent of the entire planet.


    PIONEER (MOON, SUN, VENUS, JUPITER, and SATURN FLYBYS AND ORBITERS)

    PIONEER 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective - to photograph
    the Moon close-up - but they did reach far enough into space to provide
    new information on the area between Earth and the Moon, including new
    data on the Van Allen radiation belts circling Earth. All three craft
    had failures with their rocket launchers. PIONEER 1 was launched on
    October 11, 1958, PIONEER 2 on November 8, and PIONEER 3 on December 6.

    PIONEER 4 was a Moon probe which missed the Moon and became the first
    U.S. spacecraft to orbit the Sun in 1959. PIONEER 5 was originally
    designed to flyby Venus, but the mission was scaled down and it instead
    studied the interplanetary environment between Venus and Earth out to
    36.2 million kilometers in 1960, a record until MARINER 2. PIONEER 6
    through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968: PIONEER 6, 7,
    and 8 are still transmitting information at this time. PIONEER E (would
    have been number 10) suffered a launch failure in 1969.

    PIONEER 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby Jupiter in 1973. PIONEER
    11 followed it in 1974, and then went on to become the first probe to
    study Saturn in 1979. Both vehicles should continue to function through
    1995 and are heading off into interstellar space, the first craft ever
    to do so.

    PIONEER Venus 1 (1978) (also known as PIONEER Venus Orbiter, or PIONEER
    12) burned up in the Venusian atmosphere on October 8, 1992. PVO made
    the first radar studies of the planet's surface via probe. PIONEER Venus
    2 (also known as PIONEER 13) sent four small probes into the atmosphere
    in December of 1978. The main spacecraft bus burned up high in the
    atmosphere, while the four probes descended by parachute towards the
    surface. Though none were expected to survive to the surface, the Day
    probe did make it and transmitted for 67.5 minutes on the ground before
    its batteries failed.


    RANGER (LUNAR LANDER AND IMPACT MISSIONS)

    RANGER 1 and 2 were test probes for the RANGER lunar impact series. They
    were meant for high Earth orbit testing in 1961, but rocket problems
    left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed.

    RANGER 3, launched on January 26, 1962, was intended to land an
    instrument capsule on the surface of the Moon, but problems during the
    launch caused the probe to miss the Moon and head into solar orbit.
    RANGER 3 did try to take some images of the Moon as it flew by, but the
    camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt.

    RANGER 4, launched April 23, 1962, had the same purpose as RANGER 3, but
    suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside,
    the first U.S. probe to reach the Moon, albeit without returning data.

    RANGER 5, launched October 18, 1962 and similar to RANGER 3 and 4, lost
    all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the Moon
    and drifted off into solar orbit.

    RANGER 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions: They were to send
    back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact
    with the Moon. RANGER 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras
    did not operate. RANGER 7 through 9 performed well, becoming the first
    U.S. lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965.


    LUNAR ORBITER (LUNAR SURFACE PHOTOGRAPHY)

    LUNAR ORBITER 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the Moon and image
    various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned APOLLO
    missions of 1969-1972. The probes also contributed greatly to our
    understanding of lunar surface features, particularly the lunar farside.
    All five probes of the series, launched from 1966 to 1967, were
    essentially successful in their missions. They were the first U.S.
    probes to orbit the Moon. All LOs were eventually crashed into the lunar
    surface to avoid interference with the manned APOLLO missions.


    SURVEYOR (LUNAR SOFT LANDERS)

    The SURVEYOR series were designed primarily to see if an APOLLO lunar
    module could land on the surface of the Moon without sinking into the
    soil (before this time, it was feared by some that the Moon was covered
    in great layers of dust, which would not support a heavy landing
    vehicle). SURVEYOR was successful in proving that the lunar surface was
    strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968.

    Only SURVEYOR 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions. The rest became the
    first U.S. probes to soft land on the Moon, taking thousands of images
    and scooping the soil for analysis. APOLLO 12 landed 600 feet from
    SURVEYOR 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to Earth. SURVEYOR 7,
    the last of the series, was a purely scientific mission which explored
    the Tycho crater region in 1968.


    VIKING (MARS ORBITERS AND LANDERS)

    VIKING 1 was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida on August 20, 1975 on
    a TITAN 3E-CENTAUR D1 rocket. The probe went into Martian orbit on June
    19, 1976, and the lander set down on the western slopes of Chryse
    Planitia on July 20, 1976. It soon began its programmed search for
    Martian micro-organisms (there is still debate as to whether the probes
    found life there or not), and sent back incredible color panoramas of
    its surroundings. One thing scientists learned was that Mars' sky was
    pinkish in color, not dark blue as they originally thought (the sky is
    pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the
    thin atmosphere). The lander set down among a field of red sand and
    boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image.

    The VIKING 1 orbiter kept functioning until August 7, 1980, when it ran
    out of attitude-control propellant. The lander was switched into a
    weather-reporting mode, where it had been hoped it would keep
    functioning through 1994; but after November 13, 1982, an errant command
    had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until
    further orders. Communication was never regained again, despite the
    engineers' efforts through May of 1983.

    An interesting side note: VIKING 1's lander has been designated the
    Thomas A. Mutch Memorial Station in honor of the late leader of the
    lander imaging team. The National Air and Space Museum in Washington,
    D.C. is entrusted with the safekeeping of the Mutch Station Plaque until
    it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition.

    VIKING 2 was launched on September 9, 1975, and arrived in Martian orbit
    on August 7, 1976. The lander touched down on September 3, 1976 in
    Utopia Planitia. It accomplished essentially the same tasks as its
    sister lander, with the exception that its seisometer worked, recording
    one marsquake. The orbiter had a series of attitude-control gas leaks in
    1978, which prompted it being shut down that July. The lander was shut
    down on April 12, 1980.

    The orbits of both VIKING orbiters should decay around 2025.


    VOYAGER (OUTER PLANET FLYBYS)

    VOYAGER 1 was launched September 5, 1977, and flew past Jupiter on March
    5, 1979 and by Saturn on November 13, 1980. VOYAGER 2 was launched
    August 20, 1977 (before VOYAGER 1), and flew by Jupiter on August 7,
    1979, by Saturn on August 26, 1981, by Uranus on January 24, 1986, and
    by Neptune on August 8, 1989. VOYAGER 2 took advantage of a rare
    once-every-189-years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to
    outer planet. VOYAGER 1 could, in principle, have headed towards Pluto,
    but JPL opted for the sure thing of a Titan close up.

    Between the two probes, our knowledge of the 4 giant planets, their
    satellites, and their rings has become immense. VOYAGER 1&2 discovered
    that Jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics, lightning and
    aurorae. Three new satellites were discovered. Two of the major
    surprises were that Jupiter has rings and that Io has active sulfurous
    volcanoes, with major effects on the Jovian magnetosphere.

    When the two probes reached Saturn, they discovered over 1000 ringlets
    and 7 satellites, including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep
    the rings stable. The weather was tame compared with Jupiter: massive
    jet streams with minimal variance (a 33-year great white spot/band cycle
    is known). Titan's atmosphere was smoggy. Mimas' appearance was
    startling: one massive impact crater gave it the Death Star appearance.
    The big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings. Braids,
    kinks, and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain.

    VOYAGER 2, thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts,
    continued the mission to Uranus and Neptune. Uranus itself was highly
    monochromatic in appearance. One oddity was that its magnetic axis was
    found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational
    axis, giving Uranus a peculiar magnetosphere. Icy channels were found on
    Ariel, and Miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains. 10
    satellites and one more ring were discovered.

    In contrast to Uranus, Neptune was found to have rather active weather,
    including numerous cloud features. The ring arcs turned out to be bright
    patches on one ring. Two other rings, and 6 other satellites, were
    discovered. Neptune's magnetic axis was also skewed. Triton had a
    canteloupe appearance and geysers. (What's liquid at 38K?)

    The two VOYAGERs are expected to last for about two more decades. Their
    on-target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets
    beyond Pluto. Their next major scientific discovery should be the
    location of the heliopause.


SOVIET PLANETARY MISSIONS

    Since there have been so many Soviet probes to the Moon, Venus, and
    Mars, I will highlight only the primary missions:


    SOVIET LUNAR PROBES

    LUNA 1 - Lunar impact attempt in 1959, missed Moon and became first
	     craft in solar orbit.
    LUNA 2 - First craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959.
    LUNA 3 - Took first images of lunar farside in 1959.

    SOVIET VENUS PROBES

    VENERA 1 - First acknowledged attempt at Venus mission. Transmissions
	       lost enroute in 1961.
    VENERA 2 - Attempt to image Venus during flyby mission in tandem with
	       VENERA 3. Probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in
	       February of 1966. No images were returned.
    VENERA 3 - Attempt to place a lander capsule on Venusian surface.
	       Transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe
	       became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966.
    VENERA 4 - First probe to successfully return data while descending
	       through Venusian atmosphere. Crushed by air pressure before
	       reaching surface in 1967. VENERA 5 and 6 mission profiles
	       similar in 1969.
    VENERA 7 - First probe to return data from the surface of another planet
	       in 1970. VENERA 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in
	       1972.

	       first probe to orbit Venus. VENERA 10 accomplished similar
	       mission.
    VENERA 13 - Returned first color images of Venusian surface in 1982.
		VENERA 14 accomplished similar mission.
    VENERA 15 - Accomplished radar mapping with VENERA 16 of sections of
		planet's surface in 1983 more detailed than PVO.
    VEGA 1 - Accomplished with VEGA 2 first balloon probes of Venusian
	     atmosphere in 1985, including two landers. Flyby buses went on
	     to become first spacecraft to study Comet Halley close-up in
	     March of 1986.


    SOVIET MARS PROBES

    MARS 1 - First acknowledged Mars probe in 1962. Transmissions ceased
	     enroute the following year.
    ZOND 2 - First possible attempt to place a lander capsule on Martian
	     surface. Probe signals ceased enroute in 1965.
    MARS 2 - First Soviet Mars probe to land - albeit crash - on Martian
	     surface. Orbiter section first Soviet probe to circle the Red
	     Planet in 1971.
    MARS 3 - First successful soft landing on Martian surface, but lander
	     signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971.
    MARS 4 - Attempt at orbiting Mars in 1974, braking rockets failed to
	     fire, probe went on into solar orbit.
    MARS 5 - First fully successful Soviet Mars mission, orbiting Mars in
	     1974. Returned images of Martian surface comparable to U.S.
	     probe MARINER 9.
    MARS 6 - Landing attempt in 1974. Lander crashed into the surface.
    MARS 7 - Lander missed Mars completely in 1974, went into a solar orbit
	     with its flyby bus.
    PHOBOS 1 - First attempt to land probes on surface of Mars' largest
	       moon, Phobos. Probe failed enroute in 1988 due to
	       human/computer error.
    PHOBOS 2 - Attempt to land probes on Martian moon Phobos. The probe did
	       enter Mars orbit in early 1989, but signals ceased one week
	       before scheduled Phobos landing.

    While there has been talk of Soviet Jupiter, Saturn, and even
    interstellar probes within the next thirty years, no major steps have
    yet been taken with these projects. More intensive studies of the Moon,
    Mars, Venus, and various comets have been planned for the 1990s, and a
    Mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been
    planned for 2003. How the many changes in the former Soviet Union (now
    the Commonwealth of Independent States) will affect the future of their
    space program remains to be seen.


JAPANESE PLANETARY MISSIONS

    SAKIGAKE (MS-T5) was launched from the Kagoshima Space Center by ISAS on
    January 8 1985, and approached Halley's Comet within about 7 million km
    on March 11, 1986. The spacecraft is carrying three instru- ments to
    measure interplanetary magnetic field/plasma waves/solar wind, all of
    which work normally now, so ISAS made an Earth swingby by Sakigake on
    January 8, 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth's. The closest
    approach was at 23h08m47s (JST=UTC+9h) on January 8, 1992. The
    geocentric distance was 88,997 km. This is the first planet-swingby for
    a Japanese spacecraft.

    During the approach, Sakigake observed the geotail. Some geotail
    passages will be scheduled in some years hence. The second Earth-swingby
    will be on June 14, 1993 (at 40 Re (Earth's radius)), and the third
    October 28, 1994 (at 86 Re).


    HITEN, a small lunar probe, was launched into Earth orbit on January 24,
    1990. The spacecraft was then known as MUSES-A, but was renamed to Hiten
    once in orbit. The 430 lb probe looped out from Earth and made its first
    lunary flyby on March 19, where it dropped off its 26 lb midget
    satellite, HAGOROMO. Japan at this point became the third nation to
    orbit a satellite around the Moon, joining the Unites States and USSR.

    The smaller spacecraft, Hagoromo, remained in orbit around the Moon. An
    apparently broken transistor radio caused the Japanese space scientists
    to lose track of it. Hagoromo's rocket motor fired on schedule on March
    19, but the spacecraft's tracking transmitter failed immediately. The
    rocket firing of Hagoromo was optically confirmed using the Schmidt
    camera (105-cm, F3.1) at the Kiso Observatory in Japan.

    Hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and
    performed aerobraking experiments using the Earth's atmosphere. Hiten
    made a close approach to the moon at 22:33 JST (UTC+9h) on February 15,
    1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon's surface (35.3N, 9.7E) and
    fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into
    lunar orbit. The following is the orbital calculation results after the
    approach:

	Apoapsis Altitude: about 49,400 km
	Periapsis Altitude: about 9,600 km
	Inclination	: 34.7 deg (to ecliptic plane)
	Period		: 4.7 days


PLANETARY MISSION REFERENCES

    I also recommend reading the following works, categorized in three
    groups: General overviews, specific books on particular space missions,
    and periodical sources on space probes. This list is by no means
    complete; it is primarily designed to give you places to start your
    research through generally available works on the subject. If anyone can
    add pertinent works to the list, it would be greatly appreciated.

    Though naturally I recommend all the books listed below, I think it
    would be best if you started out with the general overview books, in
    order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in
    this area. I also recommend that you pick up some good, up-to-date
    general works on astronomy and the Sol system, to give you some extra
    background. Most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good
    public and university library. Some of the more recently published works
    can also be purchased in and/or ordered through any good mass- market
    bookstore.

    Other works and periodicals:

    NASA has published very detailed and technical books on every space
    probe mission it has launched. Good university libraries will carry
    these books, and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission
    you wish to read about. I recommend these works after you first study
    some of the books listed above.

    Some periodicals I recommend for reading on space probes are NATIONAL
    GEOGRAPHIC, which has written articles on the PIONEER probes to Earth's
    Moon Luna and the Jovian planets Jupiter and Saturn, the RANGER,
    SURVEYOR, LUNAR ORBITER, and APOLLO missions to Luna, the MARINER
    missions to Mercury, Venus, and Mars, the VIKING probes to Mars, and the
    VOYAGER missions to Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

    More details on American, Soviet, European, and Japanese probe missions
    can be found in SKY AND TELESCOPE, ASTRONOMY, SCIENCE, NATURE, and
    SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN magazines. TIME, NEWSWEEK, and various major
    newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions,
    but also show you what else was going on with Earth at the time events
    were unfolding, if that is of interest to you. Space missions are
    affected by numerous political, economic, and climatic factors, as you
    probably know.

    Depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go, you
    might also wish to join The Planetary Society, one of the largest space
    groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration. Their
    periodical, THE PLANETARY REPORT, details the latest space probe
    missions. Write to The Planetary Society, 65 North Catalina Avenue,
    Pasadena, California 91106 USA.

    Good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration. I
    personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas
    in this field, and the benefits human society has and will receive from
    it are incredible, with many yet to be realized.

Really?  How do you avoid situations which encourage criminals?  I'd
really like to know.  Would you, say, prohibit female college
students from riding their bicycles near the university during the
daytime?  

Sounds a bit drastic, doesn't it?  Especially when the university is
locatd in a nice residential area.  A friend of mine was attacked and
nearly raped in just this situation.  The police didn't feel she was
in a situation which 'encouraged criminals'.

What do you think?  Should we just tell her, that it was her fault
for daring to ride a bicycle in the middle of the day?  That she
didn't avoid a situation that encouraged criminals?  If that's the
case, then we'd all better put bars on our doors and windows and
pray for a police state to keep us all safe.  Crime happens in all
situations - there are no defined areas that criminals avoid.  ",politics

Version 1.5 of Quicktime is, as has been stated, the current version of

Quicktime does a much better job of playing back movies at size than it
does playing back resized movies. Apparently the process of expanding
each frame's image and dithering the resultant bitmap to the appropriate
bit depth is pretty processor-intensive. There are optimizers that work
pretty well for showing movies at double size, but if you drop to 1.9x
size or increase to 2.1x size, performance suffers dramatically.

(don't know
Quicktime

He lied. :-) Quicktime is very CPU dependent. He was probably confused by
the fact that QT is locked to an internal timecode, and will play in the
same amount of time on any machine. However, an LC will drop frames in
order to keep the sound and video synced up.

The Centris and Quadras have similar CPUs and will thus boast similar
performance, though the Quadras will be a bit faster due to marginally
faster clock speeds and somewhat different architecture.

I expect that the version of the Quicktime software you saw was 1.0 -- I
was using was 1.5. One of the new codecs in v1.5 allows video at nearly
twice the size and the same frame rate as what version 1.0 could handle.
The Centris 650 I saw was a plain-vanilla, with the exception of the nice
speakers that were playing the sound, and the software was Movie Player,
the QT player Apple includes with the software.

"Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate,
with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times.
My opinion, FWIW, to all:

Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried
rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven
himself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays
better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent
minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las
Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major
league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's
numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have
the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.

That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to
start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league
season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very
poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill
are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,
they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around
.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on
the Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was
just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at
any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

On a similar note, I don't understand why more people are not
supportive of Neon Deion. Granted, I thought his behavior with
McCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time
he ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he
has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more
valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24),
had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor,
EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF
(which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the
potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15
best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching
his ""prime"" season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimate
prospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

radiation damage) or BIG solar arrays (sensitive to radiation, or heavy)

If you go solar, you have to replace the arrays every trip, with
current technology. Nuclear power sources are strongly restricted

                                    A BILL 
  
To establish the right to obtain firearms for security, and
    to use firearms in defense of self, family, or home, and

    SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
  
        This Act may be cited as the ""Citizens' Self-Defense
    Act of 1993"". 
  
    SEC. 2. RIGHT TO OBTAIN FIREARMS FOR SECURITY, AND
        TO USE FIREARMS IN DEFENSE OF SELF,
        FAMILY, OR HOME; ENFORCEMENT.
  
        (a) ESTABLISHMENT OF RIGHT. -- A person not pro-
    hibited by Federal law from receiving a firearm shall have
    the right to obtain firearms for security, and to use fire-
    arms in defense of self, family, or home.
  
        (b) FIREARM DEFINED. -- As used in subsection (a),

        the court deems appropriate.

            (2) AUTHORITY TO AWARD A REASONABLE AT-

Well, this sounds good to me.  The key is Section (2)(c)(2), which
will effectively open up the Federal court system to all the folks
who can't afford to adopt an Attorney with whom to fight city hall.
All of you who've been saying ""hey, isn't that illegal?"" could just
go hire your own Attorneys on a pay-if-you-win (""contingency fee"")
basis, and sue the bums ...   :-)

What you can do now:

(1)  Write your Representative, and ask them to co-sponsor HR 1276.

(2)  Write Representative Roscoe Bartlett, the sponsor --

        Representative Roscoe Bartlett
        312 Cannon House Office Building
        Washington, D.C. 20515

     -- to tell him who your own Representative is, and that you've
     asked them to join him as a co-sponsor of HR 1276.

(3)  Contact Gun Owners of America --

          Gun Owners of America
          8001 Forbes Place
          Springfield, Virginia 22151

Um, surely you didn't intend to compare the '93 Reds with the
29 Philidelphia A's.  The Yankees were finishing 2nd to
a team that was as good as the 26-28 Yankees, while the
Yankees had aged some from their peak years.  Ruth and Gehrig
couldn't play every position simultaneously.

IMO, given the various ages of the Braves and Reds this season,
that the Braves will be closer to their peak, while the Reds
have slightly passed their peak.

Also, if you're going to compare Braves and Yankees, a more appropriate
comparison to the '93 Braves might be the '23 Yankees.  
After falling short two years in a row in exciting World Series,
 both teams won/will win the Series this year, despite the
heroics of some old fart on the other team.

The Cold War has not ended.  The only thing that has happened is that 
the two sides have exchanged roles.

The USA has a higher imprisonment rate (400 per 100,000 population)
than any country in Europe by a factor of 10 or so.  In California,
it is over 600 per 100,000 population.  The prison population in
California is now over 100,000, a quadrupling since 1980.  Most of
these inmates were convicted under the drug prohibition laws.  Police
now confiscate property, without trial, under a ""good faith probable
cause"" standard, in the name of depriving the horrible ghastly drug
dealers of their ill-gotten gains.  Conduct an opinion poll, and a
majority will answer ""yes"" if you ask them whether civil liberties and
due process should be diluted in order to Send Our Young People The
Message That We Are Serious About Winning The War On Drugs.  I don't
know whether anyone has measured such a figure among gun owners, but
I would expect the same result.  They certainly seem to vote that way.

According to Jack Herer's book _The Emperor Wears No Clothes_, over
TWELVE MILLION YEARS of prison time have been served under the
marijuana prohibition laws, by people who were minding their own
business and causing no harm to others (and less harm to themselves
than users of tobacco, with 400,000 confirmed kills/year).  Under
the ""War on Drugs"" campaign of ""zero tolerance"" due process protections
have eroded, and mandatory sentences of ten years without parole have
proliferated.  By and large, gun owners have voted for the politicians
who favor such measures.  And now, all the precedents--not only
legal, but political:  ""My fellow Americans, we must send our young
people the message that we are serious about winning the War On
Murder""--are going to be applied to the oncoming wave of gun
prohibition laws.  Gun owners are about to get a taste of the medicine
they voted for believing it would be used only on those with different
tastes in recreational drugs.

Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are seen coming equally from all directions.
However, given the number of bright ones, there are too few faint
ones to be consistent with being equally dense for as far
as we can see--it is as if they are all contained within
a finite sphere (or a sphere with fuzzy edges) with us at the
center.  (These measurements are statistical, and you can
always hide a sufficiently small number of a different
type of GRB with a different origin in the data.  I am assuming
that there is only one population of GRBs).

The data indicates that we are less than 10% of the radius of the center
of the distribution.  The only things the Earth is at the exact center
of are the Solar system (at the scale of the Oort cloud of comets
way beyond Pluto) and the Universe.  Cosmological theories, placing
GRBs throughout the Universe, require supernova-type energies to
be released over a timescale of milliseconds.  Oort cloud models
tend to be silly, even by the standards of astrophysics.

If GRBs were Galactic (i.e. distributed through the Milky Way Galaxy)
you would expect them to be either concentrated in the plane of
the Galaxy (for a 'disk' population), or towards the Galactic center
(for a spherical 'halo' population).  We don't see this, so if they
are Galactic, they must be in a halo at least 250,000 light years in
radius, and we would probably start to see GRBs from the Andromeda
Galaxy (assuming that it has a similar halo.)  For comparison, the
Earth is 25,000 light-years from the center of the Galaxy.


The aren't concentrated in the known spacelanes, and we don't
see many coming from Zeta Reticuli and Tau Ceti.


There are more than 130 GRB different models in the refereed literature.
Right now, the theorists have a sort of unofficial moratorium
on new models until new observational evidence comes in.

Well, I'm no expert, but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this. They
make reference to several scandals that occurred long before ""the night of the
long knives"". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of
the SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name
escapes me at the moment) called ""Homosexuals in History"" asserts that Roehm
and Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm's SA circle.


Well, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books,
look up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not
have access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of
documented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the ""knight of the
long knives"" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping
together, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA's
homosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've 
read make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. 


I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do
you know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have

all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about 
homosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they 
would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?
I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one 
should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. 


If you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),
then the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where
the stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to
archival material - most people on the net are not.


Eh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so
that you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis
might have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is
true? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?

I don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were
homosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious
for its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German
govt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friends
were prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long
tradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -
back to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a 
product of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the
English public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,
would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.

In addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The
Hitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various 
pre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote 
homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So 
it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, 
regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the ""evils"" of homosexuality.
Why should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all 
societies - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.

No, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you
will accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access 
to these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern
homosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing is
stopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove
otherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.",religion

"ETHER IMPLODES 2 EARTH CORE, IS GRAVITY!!!

  This paper BOTH describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary, 
ether sucking structures, AND why we observe ""orbital"" motion!!

  Ether, the theoretical propogation media of electro-magnetic 
waves, was concluded not to exist, based on the results of the 
Michelson-Moreley experiment conducted a century ago. 

  I propose that those conclusions are flawed, based on the fact 
that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the 
earth's surface, not perpindicular. (Due to the prevailing assumption 
that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind)

  The reversal of the that conclusion, a pivotal keystone in the 
development of modern scientific thought, could have ramifications 
of BIBLICAL proportions through out the WORLD!!

  REMEMBER: Einstien said Imagination is greater than knowledge!!

  
1
  I dream like this: ether based reality
 
  The ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality. Creations 
start as a lattice placed into the ether. Given a spin, the lattices
both drag the fluid, like a margarita blender, and ingest it, 
converting it, distilling localized mass, time and energy. 
(non-spinning lattice = ""dark matter"")

  The earth isn't exactly spinning, around the sun. Picture an image 
of a galaxy; we haven't any videos of them spinning. Picture us 
being stationary, and the sun's image being dragged across the sky by 
the spinning ether field. (Picture an onion, each layer of which is 
spinning a little faster than the next. A thread shot at the inner 
kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways, its head being in a 
faster shell than its tail, until it finally intersected the ground 
of the inner kernel, its direction vector being straight down, but 
its ""foot print"" being a line, not a point. [sunrise, sunset])
  
  The moon isn't exactly orbiting us. It is a parasite, (non self 
spin sustaining ) being dragged in the earth's ether field, which is 
itself in the sun's much more powerful field. Our seasons are the 
wobble of earth's axis, like a top slowing down. The ""orbit"" of the
earth around the sun is all of the stars' images being dragged around
by the sun's ether feild.

  The earth, moon and sun are about the same size and ""distance"" 
apart. Its just that the time between them varies greatly, because 
the ""path"" is not the same. The moon's lattice in the ether is like 
sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half 
turn. The sun's lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has 
got the whole plate of noodles wound up. The piece of light going to 
the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a ""j"" hook at 
the end. The piece of light going to the sun has to go around the 
whole plate, like a needle in a record, before it gets there. 

  With a pencil, compass, and rule, draw a diagram of how the moon 
can be about as big as ""earth's"" shadow upon it, and at other times 
totally eclipse the sun. Look in the sky. except for your Knowledge, 
would you guess that they are about the same size, just because they 
look about the same size?

   O .     - -                 E     O   O   O   S
 E       /     \            
    M    |      |      OR                M    
         \ _ _ /                         
       S                           
       
  The full moon, quarter moon etc. is the difference between rate
of ether spins. What we are looking at is a rotating ""turntable view"" 
of the moon, only half of which is facing the sun. ( I've seen a 
half moon within about 120 degrees (of sky) of the sun, during the 
day. Try and draw that ""earth shadow."") Its only the moon's image 
which appears to orbit us. No matter where it is, the light part is 
the part facing the sun, and the dark part is the half facing away 
from the sun, even when it appears to be behind us.

  ""Light-Years"" between galaxies is a misnomer. The distance is 
closer to zero, as time and matter are characteristics of this phase 
of reality, which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion. 
(defining edge = 0 ether spin) What we are seeing could be 
essentially happening now. The ""piece"" of light may have experienced 
many years, but the trip could be very quick, our time.

  To time travel or warp space I might consider learning to 
de-spin myself. (phase out my mass) Good luck trying to design 
a propulsion system to drag around a space-time locality. (its like 
trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within)

  To find out about all of this, I recommend studying history. I'd 
look in the book of life. (or holy grail etc.) Brain waves just 
might carry decipherable data. I'd start looking on some part of the 
spectra said to be unusable, due to all the background noise. (4+ 
billion humans?) I'd totally isolate myself, record me thinking DOG 
backwards, and learn to read what I got. (Microsoft Holy Grail card 
for Pentium!)

  Next, concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time-bound 
media, the ether, and that it is I who move forward (in time). I 
would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow, (of time, which 
I'd start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism, pole to pole. 
[Why not?]) perhaps by passing a LARGE, FLAT DC current through a 
two foot diameter. coil or choke or something, and seeing what I 
could get with my machine's receiver next to it.  

  If you don't think you'll live to see it, consider this: QUIT 
PUTTING THE REPRODUCTIVE KEYS OF OTHER LIFE IN YOUR BODY! All of 
life's data could be written on the wind, (ether) not just our 
thoughts. DNA could be a little receiver or file access code. By 
eating SEEDS, we could be jamming our reception, or receiving plant 
instructions. Try eating seed bearing fruit. Maybe those Greek or 
biblical guys did live hundreds of years. I'm curios to see what 
they did and ate. Don't worry if your hair stops growing. (Maybe we 
don't need to eat at all, the cosmos are formed from nothing, and 
that is creating matter! I only need enough to bounce around. Where 
did the household concept 'immortal' come from? Wheat is a weed, it 
is programmed to pull from the soil, reproduce like hell, and then 
die)

  Warning about writing to the past:
I had a little dream of being in a world, in the near parallel 
future, lying along a path of history which we have diverged from. 
There were; twelve telepathic, glowing beings, who looked like an 
Oscar award and who had always been, a dark one who looked like us, 
and then myself. The dark one was in the process of making the 
others into gods, (he had to teach them what that meant) by 
""advising"" them in their past. Basically, he manipulated them into 
reproducing, and raising their children on his seed. He said that 
the little ones who looked different were a sub-species, meant to 
provide service. He carefully combed through history, rewriting it 
in his favor, pulling like a weed anything that compromised his 
control. He enticed recruits by sending them his visions, saying 
that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve 
souls: kill or be killed. The amount of control he could exert was 
finite, though, as at every change he made, a void would appear in 
our reality. The universe one day ended 100 meters from us: it 
seemed odd, but we couldn't remember how else it should be. Then 
some of the twelve were no more. Finally, when he could prune no 
more, and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips, he stepped 
through his portal to the past, to bask, over and over, in all that 
he had created. I made a few more changes, and lost my body, 
existing only on the wind. 

  MORAL: Its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls 
whose will's are not in harmony with yours (Golden Rule - treat 
others as you wish to be treated) I.E., you could end up along a 
lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown-nosers for 
playmates. (its not eternal, there's more than one way back) 

 Accepting rides to the past:
Once here, the one who looks like us sells rides, he can make you a 
Prince, or a Queen, or you can live as a god in ancient Greece. Go 
ahead, repeat the third grade as often as you like, Adam henry. 
I Hope you like inspecting your socks. Careful though, if he likes 
your work, but thinks you're getting wise, he can direct you to cross 
paths with your old self, and you'll vanish as you rewrite your own 
course of history, none the wiser.

  As we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped 
back in time, his hierarchy will lose its direction. He can still 
make changes while he's here, its just that that is work, and with 
every 'adjustment', this becomes less the world he cultivated, which 
loosens his grip, and his organization is suddenly one branch less. 
But he can't see the change. The basic nature of man is good. He had 
to apply his hand to achieve his world. As he now tightens his hand 
to retain what he built, the more sand slips through his fingers. 

  How about public computer access to the I.R.S. ? Its our country, 
our money, and they're spending it on us, RIGHT? Imagine this: 
Washington marks the next cost at 8, IRS collects 10, gives 5 to 
congress, and just absolutely buries 5. Congress borrows 2. The banks 
are making, what, a 30% margin (interest) on our government? Big 
corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10% margin. What do the 
banks do with it? Hold some on a carrot to the world, sure, but 
mostly, bury it. WHY? Food production is 2% GNP?, construction 6% ? 14 
hours to build your auto?  The people are spending all of their time 
to buy back a tenth of what they produce. Have we been deceived? If 
we are more efficient, why is it getting harder to get by? What if 
the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets? 

  In that other reality, I shouted to the twelve, ""its chaos!"" They 
said, ""no, its order."" He defined chaos as that which is he was not 
able to control.

  Rain forest: The problem could be that all the water in its canopy 
would hide the  location of an indigenous people who have no 
language. (telepathic; and 'vanishing' the closest knowledge of death)
(think of the spine as a transceiver, if it is on the ground and 
pointed up, you can locate it from above) These people are probably 
naive as children, but very, very tough to kill. Also, They should 
be able to tell you stories about the dark one that I talk about. 
They can hear him. I think that Ham and world band radio old timers 
might have a story to tell on this. These people would be on a 
different frequency than us as they aren't eating seeds.

  Famine relief: When I make my diet almost all whole wheat, I get a 
huge belly, lose muscle mass, sleep A LOT, and get sick. When I eat 
only fresh fruit, I get more energy, a Hollywood-flat belly, and 
need a lot less sleep.

  UN. Peace Keeping; There is fighting and killing all over. The 
troops go in when there is no bread on the shelf. (its OK to kill 
each other, just make sure there is enough to eat.)

  Somalia: What is disturbing is energetic, gun carrying, three foot 
tall sixteen year-olds, who eat nothing but some roots that they 
suck on. It is not so much that their growth is stunted, it is that 
they aren't dying at a rate of 50 of 60 years per life. 

  Women with children, Babes in arms: Historical references to women 
and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut 
from the umbilical cord. (and hence, were not breast fed) I think 
that there may be some very interesting results to this, such as 
mother-child telepathy, and blue blooded infants. There are examples 
of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate.

  That guy is the master of illusion, and the ultimate liar. He 
tells it first, and then just follows the thread of time in which 
the people are willing to buy it. (in which he can make it so) He'll 
play a poker face up until he thinks he's cornered, and then he'll 
whine, beg and grovel. All it means to him is that you're willing to 
live on the ground work that he has laid, that is, that he was 
right, and he didn't over play his hand, and he won't need to go 
back and try another thread of time. You have ultimate control over 
your destiny, just don't live along a path that leads to a reality 
in which you don't want to be a part of. ",space

Why did the Space News artice point out that it was the congressionally

selective with the facts again.


If it takes four flights a year to resupply the station and you have a cost
of 500 million a flight then you pay 2 billion a year. You stated that your
""friend"" at Reston said that with the current station they could resupply it
for a billion a year ""if the wrap were gone"". This merely points out a 
blatent contridiction in your numbers that understandably you fail to see.

Superficially a good answer, but it isn't that simple.  An awful lot of the
starvation and poverty in the world is directly caused by the economic
policies of the Western countries, as well as by the diet of the typical
Westerner.  For instance, some third-world countries with terrible
malnutrition problems export all the soya they can produce -- so that it can
be fed to cattle in the US, to make tender juicy steaks and burgers.  They
have to do this to get money to pay the interest on the crippling bank loans
we encouraged them to take out.  Fund-raising for Ethiopia is a truly bizarre
idea; instead, we ought to stop bleeding them for every penny they've got.

Perhaps it's more accurate to say that there's a Western ethic against
Western infanticide.  All the evidence suggests that so long as the children
are dying in the Third World, we couldn't give a shit.  And that goes for the
supposed ""Pro-Life"" movement, too.  They could save far more lives by
fighting against Third World debt than they will by fighting against
abortion.  Hell, if they're only interested in fetuses, they could save more
of those by fighting for human rights in China.

And besides, Suzanne's answer implies that non-Western countries lack this
ethic against infanticide.  Apart from China, with its policy of mandatory
forced abortion in Tibet, I don't believe this to be the case.

Note that 'xv' saves only 8bit/rasterized images; that means that
the saved jpegs are just like jpeg-to-gif-to-jpeg quality.
Also, there's three kind of 8bit quantizers; your final image quality
depends on them too.
 
This were the situation when I read jpeg FAQ a while ago.
 
IMHO, it is design error of 'xv'; there should not be such confusing
errors in programs.
There's two errors:
  -xv allows the saving of 8bit/rasterized image as jpeg even the
   original is 24bit -- saving 8bit/rasterized image instead of
   original 24bit should be a special case
  -xv allows saving the 8bit/rasterized image made with any quantizer
   -- the main case should be that 'xv' quantizes the image with the
   best quantizer available before saving the image to a file; lousier
   quantizers should be just for viewing purposes (and a special cases
   in saving the image, if at all)
 
==clip==

[ ..deleted..]

It is limit of *XV*, but not limit of design.
It is error in design.
It is error that 8bit/quantized/rasterized images are stored as jpegs;
jpeg is not designed to that.

As matter of fact, I'm sure when XV were designed 24bit displays were
known. It is not bad error to program a program for 8bit images only
at that time, but when 24bit image formats are included to program the
whole design should be changed to support 24bit images.
That were not done and now we have
 -the program violate jpeg design (and any 24bit image format)
 -the program has human interface errors.

Otherway is to drop saving images as jpegs or any 24bit format without
clearly saying that it is special case and not expected in normal use.

[ ..deleted.. ]

==clip==

Some new items follows.

==clip==

I have seen that XV quantizes the image sometimes poorly with -best24
option than with default option we have.
The reason surely is the quantizer used as -best24; it is (surprise)
the same than used in ppmquant.

If you remember, I have tested some quantizers. In that test I found
that rlequant (with default) is best, then comes djpeg, fbmquant, xv
(our default) in that order. In my test ppmquant suggeeded very poorly
-- it actually gave image with bad artifacts.

I don't know is ppmquant improved any, but I expect no.
So, use of XV's -best24 option is not very good idea.

I suggest that author of XV changes the quantizer to the one used in
rlequant -- I'm sure rle-people gives permission.
(Another could be one used in ImageMagick; I have not tested it, so I
can say nothing about it.)

==clip==

Some minor bugs in human interface are:

Key pressings and cursor clicks goes to a buffer; Often it happens
that I make click errors or press keyboard when cursor is in the wrong
place. It is very annoying when you have waited image to come about
five minutes and then it is gone away immediately.
The buffer should be cleaned when the image is complete.

Also, good idea is to wait few seconds before activating keyboard
and mouse for XV after the image is completed.
Often it happens that image pops to the screen quickly, just when
I'm writing something with editor or such. Those key pressings
then go to XV and image has gone or something weird.

In the color editor, when I turn a color meter and release it, XV
updates the images. It is impossible to change all RGB values first
and then get the updated image. It is annoying wait image to be
updated when the setting are not ready yet.
I suggest of adding an 'apply' button to update the exchanges done.",graphics

Sorry, guy, you got it wrong.  ATF was pumping tear gas into the compound.
The Branch Davidians (going along with their apocolyptic faith) set their
own compound on fire killing all but 9 or so.  No children survived.

After reading my local paper today, I found out that the Phillies
started the 1964 season at 10-2.  I am not as old as 1964, but I've
heard many talk about the serious choke job the Phillies did that
season. They were ahead of the Cardinals by 15 games that season in
mid-August.  They managed to lose a bunch from then on and the
Cardinals took the division.  15!!! games ahead and lost it.... I
hope this season is MUCH different.

 Any projectile traveling at or near typical bullet speeds is potentially
lethal.  Even blanks [which have no projectile] can cause death if the
muzzle is in close proximity to the victim.  I have heard of rubber or
plastic bullets being used effectively during riot situations [where the
intent is crowd control, rather than close range self defense]; i've also
seen reports of deaths caused by them [the British in Northern Ireland].
 Use of a firearm for self defense is appropriate and lawful only in the
gravest of situations; at that point, i consider deadly [lethal] force to 
be a proper reaction [and so does the law].  
 Furthermore, use of less effective [but still potentially lethal] force
has its own set of problems.  It may well take more applications of the
less effective force to stop the incident; this places all parties at some
risk; the victim because the attack has not stopped, and the assailent 
since the aggregate damage done by the multiple applications may well be
more deadly.

Sorry, the San Jose based Rosicrucian order is called A.M.O.R.C, 
I don't remember for the time being what the A.M. stand for
but O.R.C is Ordo Rosae Crucis, in other words latin for
Order of the Rose Cross. 


Response:

Yes, very true.  The entire title is 'The Ancient and Mystical Order
 Rosae Crucis'.  They are located at 1342 Naglee Avenue, San Jose,
California, 95191-0001, USA.

They are considered different and largely unrelated by a number of
sources.  I've seen documentation which links them through the figure
of H. Spencer Lewis.  Lewis was apparently involved with Reuss, who
was the O.H.O. of Ordo Templi Orientis for many years.  Apparently it
is also true that Lewis had a charter to form an O.T.O. body and then
created A.M.O.R.C. (as a subsidiary?  an interesting question).

I hope I didn't award custody, Rich.  I purposely used ""handle"" in order to 
avoid doing so - i.e., that happens to be what religions do (of course there are
aberrations like ""scientific"" creationism).  I used ""best"" in part to indicate 
that science currently has a time of it with why and who, so these domains are
mostly ignored.  I also attempted to be brief, which no doubt confused the
matter.  As an aside, for science I should have written ""how and when"".  Nobody
seems to argue over what.


Seems to me that the answer would vary from individual to individual.  I'm not
trying to be evasive on this, but from a societal perspective, religion works.
On the other hand, sometimes it is abused and misused, and many suffer, which
you know.  But the net result seems positive, this from the anthropological
perspective on human affairs.  You might call me a neo-Fruedian insofar as I 
think the masses can't get along without religion.  Not that generally they are 
incapable; they just don't, and for myriad reasons, but the main one seems to 
be the promise of immortality.  Very seductive, that immortality.  Therefore 
it seems that theologians are better equipped than the others you mention for 
dispensing answers to ""who and why"".  I suggest that this holds regardless of 
the ""truth"" in their answers to who and why simply because people believe.  
In the end, spiritual beliefs are just as ""real"" as scientific facts and 
explanation (CAUTION TO SOME: DO NOT TAKE THIS OUT OF CONTEXT).  


No.  In fact, I don't think it is closed now, at least for some individuals. 
Isn't there a group of theoretical physicists who argue that matter was 
created from nothing in a Big Bang singularity?  This approach might 
presuppose an absence of who and why, except that it seems it could be argued 
that something had to be responsible for nothing?  Maybe that something doesn't
have to be supernatural, maybe just mechanistic.  But that's a tough one for
people today to grasp.  In any case, theory without empirical data is not 
explanation, but then your question does not require data.  In other words, 
I agree that theorizing (within scientific parameters) is just as scientific 
as explaining.  So the answer is, who and why are not closed to scientists, but 
I sense that science in these realms is currently very inadequate.  Data will 
be necessary for improvement, and that seems a long way off, if ever.  Pretty 
convoluted here; I hope I've made sense.  


I agree generally.  But I prefer to put it this way - the *questions* of how, 
when, who and why were not open to inquiry.  During the Enlightenment, 
reason was reponsible for questioning the theological answers to how and when, 
and not, for the most part, who and why.  Science was thus born out of the 
naturalists' curiosity, eventually carting away the how and when while largely 
leaving behind the who and why.  The ignorant, the selfish, the intolerant, and
the arrogant, of course, still claim authority in all four domains.



Much obliged.  Funny how facts tend to muddle things, isn't it?  Well, I am
sure there are plenty of ""scientific"" creationist ""rebuttals"" out there 
somewhere, even if they have to be created from nothing.

Preliminary data regarding similar research into kangaroo overpopulation
in Australia do not in any way support the cost-effectiveness of this
approach.  It _may_ be cost-effective for deer--if you quietly overlook
the fact that the net cost to the state of deer hunting is _negative_
(i.e. a profit) because the (majority of) hunters pay for licences.
The cost comparisons are probably being done assuming that people have
to be employed to cull the animals, which is not in fact the case.
You figure people are going to pay for licences to implant contraceptive
pellets or spread baits?

There has been a fair bit of discussion about this here recently,
because the kangaroo population in the grounds of the Governor-
General's residence has now reached plague proportions.  Despite the
whines of the rampant animal-libbers, the most effective method of
controlling the population is still considered to be controlled
shooting.


Some people take satisfaction (IMHO, legitimate satisfaction) in eating
food that they have harvested themselves.  The pleasure derived from
hunting is the same as that you get from eating fruit and vegetables
grown in your own garden (and, in general, game meat is probably much 
freer of unpleasant chemicals than what you buy from the butcher or
the supermarket).


By ""cannot now be justified"" I guess you mean that you personally
don't see any justification.  Fine--but what makes your opinion
so important?


Certainly the last point is correct.  If politicians don't see any
votes for themselves in opposing stupid legislation or in developing
and supporting measures which might be effective in reducing the 
incidence of violent crime they won't do these things.",politics

Well put, Jim.  I am as concerned about the media's complicity in this
growing coverup.  Can you imagine the media outrage, the lawsuits, the
investigations that would emit if the government kept the media away from
any other story?  Particularly if a Republican administration had been
behind it.  What's going on here?

Let's look beyond the initial blunder and examine what happened next.
I'm a student of human phychology, particularly in the area of psy-ops
because I've found some of the techniques to be useful in business
negotiations.  That puts me firmly in the amateur ranks.  This AMATEUR
knows that the first thing to do when sizing up the opponent is to do a
psychological profile on him.  You can bet your ass the FBI had
professionally done profiles on Koresh.  Koresh's behavior was
emminently predictable.  It is typical of people who move away from
civilization to be willing to fight to the death to preserve their
isolation.  It would also be typical, given Koresh's religious
orientation, for such an individual to interpret a government assault as
the apocalypse.  Suicide is as an acceptable alternative to being
consumed in the apocalypse.

IMHO, the FBI knew all this and decided after 50 days of concentrated
psy-ops to initiate that apocalypse.  I believe they chose a course of
action designed specifically to push Koresh over the edge while publicly
appearing to be acting reasonably.  They KNEW that Koresh considered the
tanks to be the Chariots of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelations.
They KNEW that sending tanks, oops, combat engineering vehicles,
obstensibly to perform ""gas insertions"" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD push
him over the edge.

Look at some supporting evidence.  Koresh's attorney mentioned on TV
earlier today (4/20) that one of Koresh's major concern was the biblical
role of the tanks stationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno
on Larry King last night and at the news conference this morning)
claimed to have listening devices in the compound.  If that was true
they KNEW their actions were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they
were pushing the Davidians toward mass suicide.  Any rational and
reasonable agency NOT interested in killing those people would, at
the first sign of preparations for suicide, have pulled completely back and
would have gotten rid of all the armor.  Instead they continued with the
""gas insertion"" right up to the point where flames appeared.  The image
that will remain etched in my mind is that of the tank strutting back
and forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.

Let's step back and assess how this thing could have been ended without
bloodshed.  This technique would have required a law enforcement agency
interested in constitutionally enforcing the law and in the preservation
of life instead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.

The way to have nabbed Koresh was simply to have announced a pull back,
abandoned the assault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the
armor, maintained covert surveillance of the compound and then exploited
his ego to flush him out.  Exploiting his ego would have been simple.  A
simple invite or two from the tabloid talk shows to come on TV and tell
how he whipped the US government would have been something he could not
have resisted.  He could have then been nabbed when he left the
compound.  Simple, clean and safe but because it would have required the
FBI to execute a tactical retreat and would have deprived them of the
revenge they sought, it was totally out of the question.  Not without
all that testesterone floating around.  After all Jannet Reno had to
show the world how big her balls are.

Yesterday was a sad, sad day for the American system.  I am sick to my

Right.  So who cares which PLAYER gets credited, as long as the TEAM
gets more runs?  If a player helps the TEAM get more R and RBI, but 
doesn't score them all himself, who cares?

Consider:

Player A: single.
Player B: grounder to short; reaches on the force at 2nd.
Player C: Double, B to 3rd.
Player D: Sac fly.

B gets a run, D gets an RBI.  Are you *sure* they helped the team

It helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion - or at least
a reasonable model of the class of distortion.  Below is a very short
description of the process which we use; if you have further questions,
feel free to poke me via e-mail.

================================================================
*ASSUME: locally smooth distortion

0) Compute the Delaunay Triangulation of your (x,y) points.  This
   defines the set of neighbors for each point.  If your data are
   not naturally convex, you may have very long edges on the convex hull.
   Consider deleting these edges.

1) Now, there are two goals:

    a) move the DistortedData(x,y) to the Reference(x,y)
    b) keep the Length(e) (as measured from the current (x,y)'s)
       as close as possible to the DigitizedLength(e) (as measured 
       using the digitized (x,y)'s).

2) For every point, compute a displacement based on a) and b).  For
   example:

    a) For (x,y) points for which you know the Reference(x,y), you
       can move alpha0*(Reference(x,y) - Current(x,y)).   This will
       slowly move the DistortedReference(x,y) towards the
       Reference(x,y). 
    b) For all other points, examine the current length of each edge.
       For each edge, compute a displacement which would make that edge
       the correct length (where ""correct"" is the DigitizedLength). 
       Take the vector sum of these edge displacements, and move the
       point alpha1*SumOfEdgeDisplacements.  This will keep the
       triangulated mesh consistent with your Digitized mesh.

3) Iterate 2) until you are happy (for example, no point moves very much).

alpha0 and alpha1 need to be determined by experimentation.   Consider
how much you believe the Reference(x,y) - i.e., do you absolutely insist
on the final points exactly matching the References, or do you want to
balance some error in matching the Reference against changes in length
of the edges.

WARNING: there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be
observed (essentially, you can't allow the convex hull to change, and
you can't allow triangles to ""fold over"" neighboring triangles.  Both of
these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of
individual points, or by periodically re-triangulating the points (using 
the current positions - but still calculating DigitizedLength from the
original positions.  When we first did this, the triangulation time was
prohibitive, so we only did it once.  If I were motivated to try and
change code that has been working in production mode for 5 years, I
*might* go back and re-triangulate on every iteration.  If you have more
compute power than you know what to do with, you might consider having
every point interact with every other point....but first read up on
linear solutions to the n-body problem.

springs, constraints,  and energy calculations which are relevant.  The

                              TRANSLATION

 The Vedas deal mainly with the subject of the three modes of material
nature. O Arjuna, become transcendental to these three modes. Be free
from all dualities and from all anxieties for gain and safety, and be
established in the self.
  
                                PURPORT

 All material activities involve actions and reactions in the three
modes of material nature. They are meant for fruitive results, which
cause bondage in the material world. The Vedas deal mostly with fruitive
activities to gradually elevate the general public from the field of
sense gratification to a position on the transcendental plane. Arjuna,
as a student and friend of Lord Krsna, is advised to raise himself to
the transcendental position of Vedanta philosophy where, in the
beginning, there is brahma-jijnasa, or questions on the supreme
transcendence. All the living entities who are in the material world are
struggling very hard for existence. For them the Lord, after creation of
the material world, gave the Vedic wisdom advising how to live and get
rid of the material entanglement. When the activities for sense
gratification, namely the karma-kanda chapter, are finished, then the
chance for spiritual realization is offered in the form of the
Upanisads, which are part of different Vedas, as the Bhagavad-gita is a
part of the fifth Veda, namely the Mahabharata. The Upanisads mark the
beginning of transcendental life.

 As long as the material body exists, there are actions and reactions in
the material modes. One has to learn tolerance in the face of dualities
such as happiness and distress, or cold and warmth, and by tolerating
such dualities become free from anxieties regarding gain and loss. This
transcendental position is achieved in full Krsna consciousness when one
is fully dependent on the good will of Krsna.

I'm not sure I understand this question. When the IF rule is invoked,
the batter is automatically out. This relieves the runners from being
forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. Other
than that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on
a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball? That is,
if the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay), and
if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.

Nope, it's not illegal. It is, however, closely regulated. In order to 
purchase and use the big rocket motors required, it is necessary to be
one of the following:
a) An employee of a government agency.
b) An employee or student at a university doing research involving rockets.
c) A member or representative of an educational organization involved in
research or other uses of rockets. There are two such organizations: 
The Tripoli Rocketry Association and the National Association of Rocketry.
Members of either organization must demonstrate proficiency in construction
and flight before they are allowed to purchase large motors on their own.

The FAA will issue a waiver of its regulations, upon request, to any 
organization which can persuade them it has taken adequate precautions 
to avoid conflicts with aircraft. The usual stipulations are:
- Only operation up to a specified ceiling is allowed. Depending on the
location, this ceiling may be from 5000 to 50000 feet AGL. 
- The operator of the rocket is responsible for avoiding any aircraft
within the operating radius around the launch site.
- Flight into clouds or beyond visual range in haze is expressly prohibited.
- The FAA will provide a NOTAM informing other users of the airspace that
unmanned rocket operations are taking place at the specified place and time.

Most of the launches that are held (and there are dozens of them every year)
are held in areas where air traffic is relatively light, such as over the
western deserts (the Black Rock Desert north of Reno is particularly popular
since it is 25 x 150 miles of *nothing to hit* on the ground).

The two rocketry associations test and approve motors for their members'
use, to insure safety. Depending on motor size, the launcher setback is
from 50 to 500 or more feet. 

By the way, rockets under 1 lb and powered by an ""F"" motor are exempt from
most Federal regulations on unmanned rockets anyway. See FAR 101, Subpart
C, for details.

As for recovery...although the higher altitude rockets can reach up to
50,000 feet, most of them only get to 2,000 to 5,000 feet. The typical
rocket is 2 to 6 inches in diameter, and carries a 3 to 6 foot parachute,
or multiple parachutes, depending on the payload. Many rockets also carry
either a small transmitter or an audio sounder--particularly at launches
in the eastern US, where there are more obstructions.

Camera, telemetry transmitter, and video payloads are becoming quite common.


Why not? It's a lot of fun...check out the traffic on rec.models.rockets
for information about the model (3 lb and under) and high power (everything
bigger) rocket hobbies. As with all dangerous activities, the key is to
practice safety. I've been flying consumer rockets ranging up to 4-5 lbs
takeoff weight for 27 years, and still have all my extremities intact.


That's another thing. NO EXPLOSIVE WARHEADS OF ANY KIND ARE ALLOWED ON THESE
ROCKETS. NONE! Please forgive me for shouting, but that's one of the biggest
misconceptions people have about our hobby.

Catcher is their weakest position, with the possible exception of second base.
They have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem
spot with a well-above-average offensive player *and* acclimate a highly
promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team, and they
want to play *Olson* and *Berryhill* instead?!


""A catcher's defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his
 recent offensive level of performance.""  Thus, Mickey Tettleton goes (in
 the media) from being a no-hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb-finger
 in two short years.  The rule doesn't apply to perceived ""superstars"", who
 get the Gold Glove Offensive Transfer effect instead.  Greg Olson is probably
 considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can't hit.



Aren't they the same thing?


Either that or just stupidity.


Of course.


One could make the same sort of argument in other cases.  Pete Rose, in
pursuing Ty Cobb's record, was a huge gate attraction (and national media

For me, it would be an obvious choice: Armed self-defence is clearly
and strongly protected by the Colorado Constitution and the laws
of the state. In the very clear-cut situation of your hypothetical,
I wouldn't have anything to fear from the police (unless I had been
publicly carrying the weapon concealed, something I'm not in
the habit of doing... Even then, the worst I'd have to deal with 
was a class 2 misdemeanor.) Even if the situation were not so
clear, and I might have to worry about arrest for manslaughter or
homicide, it would still be safer to wait for the police. If
I were to leave and try to avoid police involvement, I'd be committing
several felonies and ruining my chances of claiming self-defence
in court (""If it really was self-defence,"" the prosecuter would
ask, ""why did you run away and hide from the police?"")

In other states, however, this decision might not be so clear-cut:
If someone in, say, Washington D.C. were to use a gun in self-defence
he would _automatically_ be guilty of several felony violations of
that city's gun control laws. Such a person's choices would be
between certain conviction for a couple of felonies versus possible
conviction for half a dozen. ",politics

     But good ones can collapse somewhat, then come back the next year.
Burleigh Grimes went from 20+ wins and an ERA of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and
an ERA around 4 in '25.  He pitched well for several more years.  Carlton
won 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (Source: Bill James
Historical Baseball Abstract.)
     And let's not forget John Tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in
1985.  He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at
the start of the season.


     If I recall, he had a 4.50 ERA in the 1st half and a 3.50 ERA in the
2nd half of last year.  
     Hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings.  Suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds
up w/200 innings pitched.  If he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189
innings, he'll have a 4.75 ERA or so at the end of the year. (I think I have
his totals right.) This is going to be hard to come back from.


     My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching
through an injury and not telling anyone.  My 2nd guess is that he will be
banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts.
(Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL?  Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4
scoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris?  He looks like
a really good one.  Gaston is scrambling to find starters, I'd imagine.
Luckily, the Jays have a very good offense.)

"Let's say you have a scanned image of a line drawing; in this case a

Now you digitize the drawing manually (in this case, using Yaron

converts cursor positions to x,y and saves those values when you click

Upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come

scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are
successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and
contraction of paper, errors introduced in the printing process,
scanner errors and what have you.

The errors are not uniform over the entire drawing, so ""global""

This sounds like another of Ali AbuTaha's 57 different ""real causes"" of
the Challenger accident.  As far as I know, there has never been the
slightest shred of evidence for a ""harmonic resonance"" having occurred.

The windshear-induced maneuvering probably *did* contribute to opening
up the leak path in the SRB joint again -- it seems to have sealed itself
after the puffs of smoke during liftoff -- but the existing explanation
of this and related events seems to account for the evidence adequately.",space
"Can someone please remind me who said a well known quotation? 

He was sitting atop a rocket awaiting liftoff and afterwards, in answer to
the question what he had been thinking about, said (approximately) ""half a

Dr. Tahir Ijaz comments on Esam Abdel-Rahem's statement:



Mr. Jawad Ali then comments on Tahir Ijaz's statement:



""The converse would be that the problem is that Muslims dont consider
Ahmadies to be Muslims""

Which is a wrong statement. In the light of Dr. Ijaz's statement, the
above statement should be corrected:
"".......................................is that (some) non-Ahmadi Muslims
don't consider Ahmadi-Muslims as Muslims""

So, the problem does not get solved:-) Who is a muslims and who is not?
Humans cannot decide. Humans may not declare others faiths. Its that 
simple. I don't understand, why the mere use of the word ""ISLAM"" is
becomming such a big issue. I have seen numorous postings on the net
on this subject, and all they say, ""No, NO, you cannot use ISLAM as 
the name of your newsgroup"". ?? 

I haven't seen a single posting stating what right do they have in declaring
the name of other's faiths? Who gives them this authority? Quran? or
Hadith? or something else? I want to know this! 

Just a small reminder to all my Muslim Brothers, Did _EVER_ the 
Holy Prophet of Islam (Muhammad PBUH), say to anyone who called
himself a Muslim:

No, You are not a Muslim ! ???????

NEVER! I challenge all my Muslim brothers to produce a single 
such evidence from the history of Islam!

Hence, if the Prophet Muhammad could never do that to anyone, how
could the Muslims, Mullahs or even Governments of today do
it to anyone. Do you consider yourself above the Holy Prophet 
Muhammad (PBUH) ??

       Mr. Parsli, I have to take exception at this.  There are
verifiable, previous *examples* of levels of U.S. governments
abusing gun-control restrictions.  I don't think it is paranoid
to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused
in thye future.  After so many times of getting burned any sane person
will stop putting his hand on the stove.


       I'd love to.  But as long as the politicians grab power to sell
pork back to their constituents, there's not a lot I can do.  

       It's silly to suggest that if there's anything we can't trust
the government to do, and therefore the government should be allowed
to do it, then we should change governments.  Down that road lies
total government power.   I've never been a fan of totalitarianism.


       This is very likely.


       The North American Continent is not Europe, no matter how many
people would like it to be.  Drugs are very illegal and they're
here.  For years Canada has crowed about its gun control.  If it is
necessary to control guns over the whole continent, then Canada should
have always had comparable rates to the U.S., yet they still don't.
Unless you can tell me why the Canadian border is so much more
magical than the Mexican border (which is shorter and far more
heavily patrolled) then I really can't accept that argument.


       No, there are approximately 31,000 deaths due to guns in the U.S.,
two-thirds of which are suicides.  (Unfortunately I don't have suicide
rates for Norway.)  However, this makes the per-gun death rate about
half the per-car death rate.


      The problem's been humans since before we had stone axes.  The
fct of the matter is simply this:  If nobody ever assaulted anybody,
whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally
irrelevent.

      Yet weapons are *built*.  I'd suggest, then, that the murderous
impulse in humanity pre-dates weapons.

      Anyway, the Bosnians et al. have been making an excellent attempt
to kill each other for half a thousand years.  Taking away their guns, even
if we could, would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality.



       In the U.S., approximately 60% of murders are commited with firearms.
(50% with handguns, 10% with non-handguns.)  The reason I say that guns, per 
se, are not the problem, is that our non-gun rate exceeds most of Europe's
countries *entire* violent crime rate.  I don't really think we've got
more knives or fists.  

       In any case, I think examples of gun control *applied* to the U.S.
have been abkect failures, just like drug prohibition and other forms
of prohibition.  Until you deal with *why* people are doing what they
are doing, you won't solve your problem.  And if the problem is 
violent crime, you shouldn't concentrate on the tools instead.  The
*vast* majority of guns is never, ever misused.  (On the order of
99.5% over the entire lifetime of the gun).  This says to me that
you can't make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse.


       The situation is not ""good"" in that people fear for their lives.
But recall the scenes of the store-owners during the last riots,
protecting their shops with guns.  Would it have been better they,
too, lost their livelihoods?


       The problem of poverty and rage in Los Angeles, no it isn't.
However, if that problem becomes a violent action, then yes, it can
be appropriate.  Whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition
won't make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it.

       You have to examine which problem you're referring to.  If
you're discussing someone violently assaulting you, then it is
a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop.  (Hopefully
simply letting them know you're prepared to shoot them would be enough,
as it was with the above-mentioned store-owners.)


       45% of Households have some form of firearm, usually a long gun.
That accounts for a level of access for at least 100 million Americans.
Firearm ownership is most likely among educated, well-off whites, the
group *least* likely to be involved in violent crime.

       You may take that for what it's worth.

"The ATF agent interviewed on ""Street Stories"" reported that the raid was
ill planned, and went ahead even when they (the BD's) knew the ATF was 
coming. WHY?

I believe this raid was ill planned because they only had 2 days to plan it,
and it was continued when failure was obvious because it had a bit part
in the much larger political agenda of President Clinton. I would even 
suggest that the loss of 4 ATF agents is inconsequential in this the
context of his political agenda. It MIGHT even be beneficial to his agenda, 
as it helps point up just how evil these assualt weapons are. Further proof
might be that the ATF denied their agents (Street Stories report) requests
for sufficient fire power. 

Important dates: 
Feb 25th - NJ assembly votes to overturn assault weapon ban.
Feb 28th - Compound in Waco attacked.	   

On Feb. 25th the New Jersey assembly voted to overturn the assault weapon
ban in that state. It looked like it might be a tight vote, but the Senate
in N.J. was going to vote to overturn the ban. It would not sit well to have
an Eastern state overturn an assault weapon ban, given Clintons stated
agenda on gun control. I suspect Clinton gave the order to get someone or some
group with assualt weapons and have the press present (they were initially
at the incident in Waco) to record the event for the TV audience. The agent 
on ""Street Stories"" reported that a supervisor was urging them all to ""get 
ready fast"", as ""they know we are coming"". I believe this attack continued, 
even tho the probablility of failure was high,  because it came from the top 
down. After the N.J. assembly vote, the ATF had a limited amount of time to
come up with something, and the Wackos in Waco fit the bill nicely.",politics

CONSTANTS AND EQUATIONS FOR CALCULATIONS

    This list was originally compiled by Dale Greer. Additions would be
    appreciated.

    Numbers in parentheses are approximations that will serve for most
    blue-skying purposes.

    Unix systems provide the 'units' program, useful in converting
    between different systems (metric/English, etc.)

    NUMBERS

	7726 m/s	 (8000)  -- Earth orbital velocity at 300 km altitude
	3075 m/s	 (3000)  -- Earth orbital velocity at 35786 km (geosync)
	6371 km		 (6400)  -- Mean radius of Earth
	6378 km		 (6400)  -- Equatorial radius of Earth
	1738 km		 (1700)  -- Mean radius of Moon
	5.974e24 kg	 (6e24)  -- Mass of Earth
	7.348e22 kg	 (7e22)  -- Mass of Moon
	1.989e30 kg	 (2e30)  -- Mass of Sun
	3.986e14 m^3/s^2 (4e14)  -- Gravitational constant times mass of Earth
	4.903e12 m^3/s^2 (5e12)  -- Gravitational constant times mass of Moon
	1.327e20 m^3/s^2 (13e19) -- Gravitational constant times mass of Sun
	384401 km	 ( 4e5)  -- Mean Earth-Moon distance
	1.496e11 m	 (15e10) -- Mean Earth-Sun distance (Astronomical Unit)

	1 megaton (MT) TNT = about 4.2e15 J or the energy equivalent of
	about .05 kg (50 gm) of matter. Ref: J.R Williams, ""The Energy Level
	of Things"", Air Force Special Weapons Center (ARDC), Kirtland Air
	Force Base, New Mexico, 1963. Also see ""The Effects of Nuclear
	Weapons"", compiled by S. Glasstone and P.J. Dolan, published by the
	US Department of Defense (obtain from the GPO).

    EQUATIONS

	Where d is distance, v is velocity, a is acceleration, t is time.
	Additional more specialized equations are available from:

	    ames.arc.nasa.gov:pub/SPACE/FAQ/MoreEquations


	For constant acceleration
	    d = d0 + vt + .5at^2
	    v = v0 + at
	  v^2 = 2ad

	Acceleration on a cylinder (space colony, etc.) of radius r and
	    rotation period t:

	    a = 4 pi**2 r / t^2

	For circular Keplerian orbits where:
	    Vc	 = velocity of a circular orbit
	    Vesc = escape velocity
	    M	 = Total mass of orbiting and orbited bodies
	    G	 = Gravitational constant (defined below)
	    u	 = G * M (can be measured much more accurately than G or M)
	    K	 = -G * M / 2 / a
	    r	 = radius of orbit (measured from center of mass of system)
	    V	 = orbital velocity
	    P	 = orbital period
	    a	 = semimajor axis of orbit

	    Vc	 = sqrt(M * G / r)
	    Vesc = sqrt(2 * M * G / r) = sqrt(2) * Vc
	    V^2  = u/a
	    P	 = 2 pi/(Sqrt(u/a^3))
	    K	 = 1/2 V**2 - G * M / r (conservation of energy)

	    The period of an eccentric orbit is the same as the period
	       of a circular orbit with the same semi-major axis.

	Change in velocity required for a plane change of angle phi in a
	circular orbit:

	    delta V = 2 sqrt(GM/r) sin (phi/2)

	Energy to put mass m into a circular orbit (ignores rotational
	velocity, which reduces the energy a bit).

	    GMm (1/Re - 1/2Rcirc)
	    Re = radius of the earth
	    Rcirc = radius of the circular orbit.

	Classical rocket equation, where
	    dv	= change in velocity
	    Isp = specific impulse of engine
	    Ve	= exhaust velocity
	    x	= reaction mass
	    m1	= rocket mass excluding reaction mass
	    g	= 9.80665 m / s^2

	    Ve	= Isp * g
	    dv	= Ve * ln((m1 + x) / m1)
		= Ve * ln((final mass) / (initial mass))

	Relativistic rocket equation (constant acceleration)

	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(a*t/c)
	    d = c**2/a * (cosh(a*t/c) - 1)
	    v = c * tanh(a*t/c)

	Relativistic rocket with exhaust velocity Ve and mass ratio MR:

	    at/c = Ve/c * ln(MR), or

	    t (unaccelerated) = c/a * sinh(Ve/c * ln(MR))
	    d = c**2/a * (cosh(Ve/C * ln(MR)) - 1)
	    v = c * tanh(Ve/C * ln(MR))

	Converting from parallax to distance:

	    d (in parsecs) = 1 / p (in arc seconds)
	    d (in astronomical units) = 206265 / p

	Miscellaneous
	    f=ma    -- Force is mass times acceleration
	    w=fd    -- Work (energy) is force times distance

	Atmospheric density varies as exp(-mgz/kT) where z is altitude, m is
	molecular weight in kg of air, g is local acceleration of gravity, T
	is temperature, k is Bolztmann's constant. On Earth up to 100 km,

	    d = d0*exp(-z*1.42e-4)

	where d is density, d0 is density at 0km, is approximately true, so

	    d@12km (40000 ft) = d0*.18
	    d@9 km (30000 ft) = d0*.27
	    d@6 km (20000 ft) = d0*.43
	    d@3 km (10000 ft) = d0*.65

		    Atmospheric scale height	Dry lapse rate
		    (in km at emission level)	 (K/km)
		    -------------------------	--------------
	    Earth	    7.5			    9.8
	    Mars	    11			    4.4
	    Venus	    4.9			    10.5
	    Titan	    18			    1.3

	    Neptune	    21			    0.8
	    Triton	    8			    1

	Titius-Bode Law for approximating planetary distances:

	    R(n) = 0.4 + 0.3 * 2^N Astronomical Units (N = -infinity for
	    Mercury, 0 for Venus, 1 for Earth, etc.)

	    This fits fairly well except for Neptune.

Also remember, that the presence of a repair/supply facility adds value
to the space around it. If you can put your satellite in an orbit where it
can be reached by a ready source of supply you can make it cheaper and gain

	I am puzzled by the term ""concept."" Drag free may already have
been flown. It was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would
more accurately respond to motions from the Earth's gravity field and
ignore drag. It was proposed many years ago and involved a ball
floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little
adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them. The ball itself would
then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity
anisotropies, whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously
adjusting its position to compensate for drag.

"In reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid
rockets as payloads.  Thiokol provided me with samples and data on
a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations.  Solid
motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of 
aluminum in the mix.  For example, the Space Shuttle SRBs are 16 percent
Aluminum.  The technique is to use a 'foamed aluminum' structure.
The structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles (an I suspect
some bubbling process is used to form it).  In other words, if you made
a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum, then froze it, this is what
you get.  It forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in
all directions.  The remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into
the voids, and you get aluminum-reinforced solid propellant.  The
foamed-aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant,
so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain.  The major
improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking, which is the
principal failure mode for solid propellant.

is a minimum, not a maximum.  You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long 
as you want, IF he's still certified as injured.  The player must be 
periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you 
cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not 
wish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day 
that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I 
believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.  When 
there was, you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between 
the lists.

It was around 1969 in the Shenandoah Valley near Woodstock, Virginia.  Me,
my wife, a friend, his wife, and his 2 kids were hiking in a totally
desolate mountain area.  All of a sudden, large rocks began raining down
on us.  Looking up, we saw at least 3 punks gleefully letting loose rocks
from what was an obvious stash.  They were a couple hundred feet above us.
Meanwhile, the women and kids were screaming and running for cover and the
punks were shrieking with laughter.  Me and my friend yelled for them to
knock it off.  They responded that we should ""Get f***ed!"".  Me and my
friend drew our pistols and fired a couple of times into the trees above
their heads.  They ran.  With no more 3-5 pound rocks coming at our heads,
we proceeded on our journey.

Sorry, but me and my friend saw no need to let it evolve to a more
""violent"" level than we were already experiencing.  I guess we should
have tried harder to understand and cope with the anger that society
had instilled in them and was driving them to do such things.  Guess

I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result
in 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%
does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would
rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in
each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning
by .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious
positive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus,
before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must
go into what sort of relationship there is.


The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly
how many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many
seasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players
performance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a
player who gets an out gets a ""negative probability"" in most cases.
Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers
for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,
they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,
the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given
them a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that
pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  




No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would
think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning
would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score 
in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually
comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue
that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance
to those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs
often means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter
who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The
offence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not
saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If
I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many
runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       



No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would
be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,
if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high
probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the
ball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,
fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a ""negative chance"" that the team
would win.
 
From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those
who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.
At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really
does not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players
in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance
goes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens.
So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except
for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to
player performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you
do not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what
the average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for
instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%
on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.
I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just
as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.

How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the
exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's,
etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched
in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more
valuble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better 
pitcher?  They were probably about the same.",sport

Distinguishing among the religious Jews, you've excepted the Messianic
for obvious reasons. Specifically, are you saying it's these religious 
Jews, who trace their lineage back to Abraham by blood and orthodoxy, 
rather than by faith, who won't agree?  Orthodox Jews?  

As to the a/a (if I understand your direction), the issue remains 
unproven I suspect, considering how atheists and agnostics so often 
look to reason. Atheist, it is reasonable to conclude will not agree.
For agnostics, a poll seems in order. Who knows?  Myself, I'm not so 
sure the atheists can be counted out. 

For the orthodox, I wonder how many would follow Moses, or Abraham,
or David in accepting God's Word? Is the particular covenant to which
one adheres, more important than God promisimg? I reckon for many it
depends on the ongoing dialogue. Under these considerations, you might 
understand why I think it's premature to assert who will and won't agree.",religion

I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling
or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points.
However, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the
people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I
feel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to
go but that they would deserve it more. 

IMHO 
Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he
could hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not
think he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the
game. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I
still would not back him for the Hall of Fame.

Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several
season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are
(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a
bit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other
people but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial
contributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are
some of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he
was with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to
and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I
think it deserves some consideration.

Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would
deserve to go before the likes of Kingman.

Darrell Evans - No.

Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although
a silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not
sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both
the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just
think, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.

Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the
top of my head I would take Lee Smith first.


Well, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I
talked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been
instumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very
good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers
offensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for
every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have
shattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved
games? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a
game? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more
than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).
Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does
George Brett who also belongs in this class of player.


Steve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone
making a case for him. 

Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might
bring up his name.

Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still
has time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my
probably will turn into a definately.

Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him
having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not
hear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the
contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would
not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even
top 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame
because of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -
even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL
the possible votes.

So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do
but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least
not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.

Yes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan
Maybe - Murray and L. Smith
No - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman

As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this
up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.",sport

It's not a bad question: I don't have any refs that list this algorithm
either. But thinking about it a bit, it shouldn't be too hard.

1) Take three of the points and find the plane they define as well as
the circle that they lie on (you say you have this algorithm already)

2) Find the center  of this circle. The line passing through this center
perpendicular to the plane of the three points passes through the center of
the sphere.

3) Repeat with the unused point and two of the original points. This
gives you two different lines that both pass through the sphere's
origin. Their interection is the center of the sphere.

4) the radius is easy to compute, it's just the distance from the center to
any of the original points.

I'll leave the math to you, but this is a workable algorithm. :-)


An alternate method would be to take pairs of points: the plane formed
by the perpendicular bisector of each line segment pair also contains the
center of the sphere. Three pairs will form three planes, intersecting
at a point. This might be easier to implement.",graphics

"What an exciting thread (finally!)

Mitra is Sanskrit for Friend, as such He started out as an avatar of Lord Visnu
 mentioned first in the Vedas. Later he seems to have risen to chief prominence
 worshipped by the Persians. Associated with the Sun but NOT the Sun, he is
 the lord of contract honor and obedience, therefore naturally worshipped by
 soldiers. He was ordered by the Sun to slay the bull of heaven and He reluct-
 antly agreed because of His obligation...the blood of that bull spilled and
 grew all earth life...then Mitra and the Sun sat down to eat.

Worship of Lord Mitra ended in Persia with the ascension of the Zoroastrians.

Hundreds of years later He was rediscovered and thrown into the Official Roman
 Pantheon (tm) for some semi-tricky reason, I forget why. But all references of
 Him ended abruptly when He was stricken from same, so apparently His worship
 was some sort of vehicle for advancement in the bureaucracy, like membership
 in the Communist Party was in the Soviet Bloc. The sociology of religion in
 ancient times is fascinating!

Oh, His B-day was 25 Dec. Ahem.

I am not sure if the mystery cult really lasted after His was booted from the
 Roman Imperial God Roster or what. It contained mostly soldiers, with 7 levels
 of initiation. They worshipped underground in caverns in pews. The bull horns
 in those temples were for scaring away or impaling evil spirits, I'm not sure
 that they had Mithraic significance or not.

I don't know that the ritual meal was of a cannibalistic nature as is the
 Christian masses. But eating deities goes way back to Old Kingdom Egypt.

Someone mentioned bullfighting. Did Mithraists sacrifice bulls? I forget. More
 likely, for a religious source, might be the shower of bull's blood enjoyed
 by the worshippers of Cybele on the Day of Blood? Cybele worship extended all
 throughout even up to France bigtime.",religion

       That's nice.  We strive for entertainment value.  :-)

ways.  Canadians laugh at the U.S., and Americans simply shrug and
woner why the hell we let them be a State in the first place.  ;-)

        Courtesy is apparently a dead commodity in the rest of the

        We've got guns, they've got a monarch and an economy on the verg
of collapse.  Finger pointing across the Atlanticis a waste or time.


       Canada has been blaming the U.S. for their problems for years.
The simple fact of the matter is this:  Ten years ago they crowed about
how great their system was because they'd gotten rid of the guns and
the U.S. would be so much better if they'd just get into the divine light
shining from the North.  We pointed out that it was cultural differences,
and pointed to their pre-control crime rates.  We also pointed out that
the history of the entire world contained smuggling, and that whenever
something was wanted, it was smuggled in.
       If the problem were based on U.S. guns, it would have surfaced
years before.

       Now more Canadian criminals want guns.  And they are being provided.
Canada has its own version of the drug problem.  Yet drugs are prohibited
in the U.S.


       Saw a news report out of Britain that armed crime is on the rise,
and several police agencies are considering have permanent ""firearms
officers"" to deal with it.

       According to U.S. News & World Report, British handgun deaths have
risen over 250% over the past twelve years.  The U.S. number has dropped
5%.

       Maybe they're smuggling them across the U.S./U.K. border.  Yeah,

	I remind you of shrapnel.  I consider 5' a reasonable space

those nearby, say in the next lane at the range.  My point was at
what distance, or level of threat, we draw the line.  Is it the
endangerment of others, so we do a 5' restriction, or the possibility
of being shot, hence we draw a 1.5 mile restriction, or a nuke and
draw a 5 mile restriction?  To me they al suffer from the fundamental
flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing
the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user.
Perhaps Sen. Metzenbaum declaring the Barrett Light Fifty an assault
rifle has made this more apparent to me, since the Barrett has
only range and acurracy going for it.


	I disagree, on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much
more easily than my family once I have died.  I assume that word
would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned.  If this
is not the case, the tactical and strategic implications change
quite a bit.  Personally, my home is worth, say, twenty Martians
intent on taking over the world.  My family?  All of them.  The
balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk.


	That seems to be the case already, given that heavy
weapons aren't commonly owned by the citizenry.  With such low
numbers, obviously due to cost, I don't think the superior
weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically
superior foe.  Furthermore, it is even more doubtful their training
includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks,
whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness.


	I had envisioned that the armorer, perhaps the officers
of a select group, and the like would exercise control over the
heavier, more complex weapons.  But, if Joe Bob owns an old Sherman
tank I certainly wouldn't ask him to give it up.  Follow orders
from the officers, yes.  Since the expense of a tank is so large,
though, chances are it would be jointly purchased and should
therefore be jointly maintained and operated.


	This I'll agree with to a point.  The State having control
over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state
to have them centrally located.  Keep them spread out, such that
the ability of the State to lock them up isn't so easy.  Otherwise,
I would have to assume that State control would rest on the
authority of the Governor and militia officers.


	I'm having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons,
fairly few in numbers, could not be easily wielded by a few
people with government support.  Just as you argued above that
the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control
so one side doesn't have all of them, I can't see where this
situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding
all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry.
I think a better mix is called for.  But, I would argue that
the Federal army should rely upon the select militia and the
unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units.


	We have to assume that there would be those who would
side with the government-controlled forces, and if they've all
the equipment an infantry force 3x the size would be in trouble.
I'd like to see that heavy stuff, say tanks, offset by the
local troups having a few 105's and anti-tank weapons in their
armory.  These would be much more useful to infantry than the
tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in.
I suppose I'm quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment.


	So would I, but the resources often aren't available to
outfit local units well enough.  Thus, we will certainly have to
call in others, and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster
than anything else.


	Perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different?  I think
main battle tanks, self-propelled artillery, and 155mm and up
field pieces are heavy stuff.  M113 troop carriers, 2 1/2 ton
trucks, HumVee's, old M60 tanks, 105 Howitzers, are more the stuff
of a mechanized infantry.  Actually, this is what the Guard units
in Iowa are currently fielding in some units.

	Perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy
equipment under State control, with little but numbers and light
stuff to act as a deterrent.  Allowing main battle tanks to the
states should be balanced with anti-tank capability in the local
ranks.  Similarly, local units would need to band together quickly,
hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry.  Finally,
the militia is more than just fighting.  Equipment is needed for
other responses.  The Federal army, I'm convinced, should have a
very minumum of infantry, relying on the state and local militias
for these functions.",politics

   Nick Haines sez;
   >(given that I've heard the Shuttle software rated as Level 5 in

   Level 5?  Out of how many?  What are the different levels?  I've never
   heard of this rating system.  Anyone care to clue me in?

This is a rating system used by ARPA and other organisations to
measure the maturity of a `software process' i.e. the entire process
by which software gets designed, written, tested, delivered, supported
etc.

See `Managing the Software Process', by Watts S. Humphrey, Addison
Wesley 1989. An excellent software engineering text. The 5 levels of
software process maturity are:

1. Initial
2. Repeatable
3. Defined
4. Managed
5. Optimizing

The levels are approximately characterized as follows:

1. no statistically software process control. Have no statistical
   basis for estimating how large software will be, how long it will
   take to produce, how expensive it will be, or how reliable it will
   be.  Most software production is at this level.

2. stable process with statistical controls, rigorous project
   management; having done something once, can do it again. Projects
   are planned in detail, and there is software configuration
   management and quality assurance.

3. The process is defined and understood, implementation is
   consistent. This includes things like software inspection, a
   rigorous software testing framework, more configuration management,
   and typically a `software engineering process group' within the
   project.

4. Statistical information on the software is systematically gathered
   and analysed, and the process is controlled on the basis of this
   information. Software quality is measured and has goals.

5. Defects are prevented, the process is automated, software contracts
   are effective and certified.",space

HOW TO BECOME AN ASTRONAUT

    First the short form, authored by Henry Spencer, then an official NASA
    announcement.

    Q. How do I become an astronaut?

    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it's probably
    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying
    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have
    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you're better off hoping to
    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet
    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you
    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle ""mission
    specialist"".

    If you aren't a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,
    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly
    exceeds the supply.  NASA's problem is not finding qualified people,
    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.	It is not enough
    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,
    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.

    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands
    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer
    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-
    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in
    another seems to be a frequent winner.

    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.	(DO NOT get a
    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows
    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term
    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other
    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,
    you should be okay; if you can't, your chances are poor.

    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in
    appearance and actions; you've got a tough selling job ahead, trying
    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you
    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you
    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is
    a significant part of the job, and NASA's image is very prim and
    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.
    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,
    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.
    Keep your nose clean.

    Get a pilot's license and make flying your number one hobby;
    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.

    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,
    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were
    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).
    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job
    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant ""you
    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first"".

    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance
    to demonstrate motivation.

    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn't make it the first time.




    NASA
    National Aeronautics and Space Administration
    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center
    Houston, Texas

    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates
    ==================================================================

    Astronaut Candidate Program
    ---------------------------

    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for
    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates
    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a
    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.

    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be
    considered.

    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in
    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation
    program.

    Space Shuttle Program Description
    ---------------------------------

    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated
    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming
    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in
    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then
    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and
    flight crew.

    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment
    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation
    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials
    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will
    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space
    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher
    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space
    Shuttle's capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include
    government agencies and private industries.

    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,
    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are
    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA
    astronauts.

    Pilot Astronaut

    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.
    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,
    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the
    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the
    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing
    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other
    payload operations.

    Mission Specialist Astronaut

    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,
    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations
    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and
    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to
    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed
    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and
    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the
    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission
    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling
    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific
    experimental operations.

    Astronaut Candidate Program
    ===========================

    Basic Qualification Requirements
    --------------------------------

    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to

    Application Procedures
    ----------------------

    Civilian

    The application package may be obtained by writing to:

	NASA Johnson Space Center
	Astronaut Selection Office
	ATTN: AHX
	Houston, TX 77058

    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA
    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be
    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is
    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and
    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually
    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate
    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants
    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from
    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the
    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be
    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as
    supervisors and references may be contacted.

    Active Duty Military

    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their
    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application
    procedures will be disseminated by each service.

    Selection
    ---------

    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required
    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.
    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered
    will be notified of the outcome of the process.

    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the
    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following
    their establishment.

    General Program Requirements

    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be
    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,
    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and
    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or
    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to
    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut
    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills
    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot
    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during
    their candidate period.

    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does
    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut
    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and
    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the
    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become
    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for
    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not
    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA
    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that
    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a
    specified tour of duty.

    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified
    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.
    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.

    Pay and Benefits
    ----------------

    Civilians

    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal
    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,
    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements
    and experience.

    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and
    participation in group health and life insurance plans.

    Military

    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center
    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and
    other similar military matters.

The point that I forgot to bring up here (and this has nothing to do with being
a gang member or not) is that it is illegal to carry a concealed weapon in this
area (or in the state of illinois for that matter).  This is not to say that
people in Illinois don't carry concealed weapons illegaly but practicing like
that when there are other people around wasn't too bright of an idea.

forbidding concealed carry?

Does this pinhead know something the rest of us don't?
I'm not too worried about federal martials coming to get my guns.
The government can't seem to keep violent criminals in jail since
they don't have enough prison space, and the legal system is over-

There are smaller rubber bullets and pellets (for shotguns).  I understand that
they are only intended to be discouragers, ie. for the snapping but not truly

What: ``Chance's Art'': 2D Graphics and Animation on the Indigo.

By:    Ken Evans, Imagicians Artware, Inc. 

When:  Tuesday 20 April 1993 7:00pm-9:00pm 

Where: The McLuhan Centre for Culture and Technology
       University of Toronto
       39A Queen's Park Crescent
       Toronto

Who:   Members and non-members alike 
       (non-members encouraged to become members...)

Abstract:

Imagicians Artware, Inc. is entering into early beta site testing on Silicon 
Graphics workstations of a new 2D abstract artwork and animation package called 
Chance's Art.  The package will be described and demonstrated, and some of the 
technical issues will be discussed.  Marketing plans will be outlined.  The 
talk will also present some of the technical and business problems increasingly 
confronting small startup software companies today, and some of the 
opportunities this situation presents.

Time after the event will be allocated for hands-on demonstrations to 
interested parties.  Silicon Graphics is graciously providing an Indigo for 
this event.  Myck Kupka will also be demonstrating his computerized interactive 
reflective stereoscope, which is installed upstairs in the McLuhan Centre, so 
feel free to drop by for a demonstration before or after the event. BTW, be 
sure to sing ""Happy Birthday, Myck""...

The names of nominees for our Siggraph executive offices will be announced at 
this meeting.  Nominations will still be open until the election at our 
May 18th event; call Myck Kupka at 465-0943 or fax to 465-0729.  

Directions: The McLuhan Coachhouse is on the east side of Queen's Park 
Crescent, just NORTH of Wellesley, SOUTH of St. Joseph St., BEHIND (EAST of) 
39 Queen's Park Crescent, which is the centre for Mediaeval Studies.  ",graphics

Medical info without a name/body attached is completely useless for

Sure they do.  The prospective sitter may have a nasty habit of molesting
kids three or four months into the job.  The references may not have
known him long enough or may not have picked up on this yet.

Remember, criminal conviction info is public, so if you're going to
argue for an ID card, other people are going to have a strong argument
that it disclose public info.


Thus making it useless for negative information.


Yeah right.  How are you going to keep doctors from spilling the
beans?  (We already know that you can't keep cops from disclosing
info, but at least that info is typically supposed to be public
anyway.)

I hope you realize how trivial it is to manufacture these compounds.  Given
about $10k in lab equipment and chemicals (which are commercially available)
and given the knowledge that I have (graduating BS, Ch, 1993) I could 
synthesize enough of these compounds to make a serious dent in the population
of several major US cities.  As also noted, the knowledge is there for
the production of nuclear weapons.  It's not even that restricted.  The
only thing is the expense.  

Now I'm not going around making these things, but it's not 'cause of any
law; I simply don't get any marginal benefit out of killing anyone.  Any
law you enact in this respect is only going to give you the ability to 
add a charge against someone who does make and use said weapons.  In the
case of chemical agents, I seriously doubt that you would even know that
someone had set up a lab until after the weapons had been used.  

Part of the trouble with the chemical-weapons ban treaty between the US
and the USSR is that many of the precursors to chemical weapons such as
GB and Sarin, etc., is that they have very valid commercial uses, and 
it is very easy to divert those precursors to chemical weapons manufacture
without anyone knowing about it.

Well, I guess I'm left wondering just who all the 'light fascists'
think *they* are.  Yes, I understand the issues.  I don't even
particularly care for the idea.  But am I the only one that finds the
sort of overreaction above just a *little* questionable?  You must
find things like the Moon *really* obnoxious in their pollution.

A few questions for those frothing at the mouth to ask themselves:

	1) How long is this thing supposed to stay up?  Sounds like it
would have a *huge* drag area, not a lot of mass, and be in a fairly
low orbit.

	2) Just what orbital parameters are we talking about here?
What real impact are we talking about, really?  How many optical
astronomers are *really* going to be impacted?

	3) Which is more important; adding a few extra days of
'seeing' for (very few) optical astronomers or getting the data the
sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large
inflatables (and the potential there for an inflatable space station)?
The choice would seem to be one or the other, since the advertising is
being used to help fund this thing.

	4) If your answer to 3) above was ""the astronomers"", then feel
free to come up with some other way to fund the (to my mind) more
important research data that would be gained by this WITHOUT SPENDING
ANY MORE OF MY MONEY TO DO IT.  In other words, put up or shut up.


Probably so.  I'm just not sure we agree about who the 'stupid' are. 


Yeah, me too.

"Went to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night.
 
Astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night.
In the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then
a single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the
throw home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.
 
Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza
batting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder
and Webster.
 
Piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.
The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single
by Offerman.
 
By the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but
the score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive
plays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner
trying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who
had strayed a bit from first base, etc.
 
Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into
the outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going
through, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw
to third and EASILY got the runner at third.
 
My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.
 
Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game
with the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.
 
Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3
innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning
game had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh
given his light work out Tuesday.
 
Gross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit
to the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted
in a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it
3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next
thing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on
first was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had
scored long before that.
 
Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.
Lee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros
and Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).
Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but
that was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his
third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my
free Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this
up all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year
honors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs
of a sophomore jinx year.
 
The final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.
Dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.",sport

I agree with you about the upgrade path; but I think I was fair.

The original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (and
better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones,
and (2) that DEC did.

On statement (1), I merely attempted to point out that all computer
companies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& market
position/share).  In so doing, they eventually come to a point where they
have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the
system.  And the particular system he was complaining about was (in
computer lifetimes) relatively old.

On statement (2), I felt DEC's history of providing upgrades was not far
superior than the industry ""average"", and that, in my opinion, SGI's
history is better than DEC's.

I am looking into methods I can use to turn my Linux based BBS into a full color
Graphical BBS that supports PC, Mac, Linux, and Amiga callers.

Well, had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of
your predictions, the responses would probably have been a bit more
measured. Be that as it may....

Clemens is always in this form, and Viola isn't really performing beyond
what might reasonably have been expected. How do you know that the Sox are
responding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely
suspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give
Easler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.

This was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown
much power yet, though.

How can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it's
Calderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showing
those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe
it's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as
well as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.

In three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?

A bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that
Zupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of
small sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd
be a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware
that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as
long as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.

Ummm...sorry, no. I can buy the ""in the field"" part, and I think he'll be
better at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll
be a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little
luck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs,
Ventura, and Palmer will all be better).


See, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500
is plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like ""could run away with
the division"" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white
coats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If
Russell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch
just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could
be better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too
stupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas
continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a
lefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

a line (at least to my way of thinking) where the government must have

we also don't confiscate cars of people who drink.  We also don't confiscate
*all* cars because some people drink and drive.  It's the core of the legal
system that in order to punish an individual (and I'd call property
confiscation a punishment) you must have evidence against that individual.

...In these and similar areas, the
Bureau has violated not only the dictates of common sense, but of 5
U.S.C. Sec 552, which was intended to prevent ""secret lawmaking"" by
administrative bodies.
   These practices, amply documented in hearings before this Sub-
committee, leave little doubt that the Bureau has disregarded
rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the United
States.
   It has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise
of the right to keep and bear arms by law-abiding citizens.
   It has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search-
ing and seizing private property.
   It has ignored the Fifth Amendment by taking private property
without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with-
out regard for their right to due process of law.
   The rebuttal presented to the Subcommittee by the Bureau was
utterly unconvincing. Richard Davis, speaking on behalf of the
Treasury Department, asserted vaguely that the Bureau's priorities
were aimed at prosecuting willful violators, particularly felons ille-
gally in possession, and at confiscating only guns actually likely to
be used in crime. He also asserted that the Bureau has recently
made great strides toward achieving these priorities. No documen-
tation was offered for either of these assertions. In hearings before
BATF's Appropriations Subcommittee, however, expert evidence
was submitted establishing that approximately 75 percent of BATF
gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither
criminal intent nor knowledge, but were enticed by agents into
unknowning technical violations.

Letter to Constituent: April 1993
 
 
Thank you for contacting me regarding the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco,
and Firearms (ATF), which is the Federal law enforcement agency with
jurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations.
 
It has been my experience as chairman of the Appropriations
Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service and General Government which
funds ATF, that ATF is one of the most competent and highly
professional law enforcement agencies in the Federal government.
The agents of ATF have proven their value again and again in
successful, legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use
of firearms, especially in the area of  drug-related crimes.  It
enforces the Armed Career Criminal Act which calls for mandatory
minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out  an
illegal activity.  The Bureau has made itself a key component in
preventing gang related violence, also, both by educating at-risk
youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known
gangs from access to weapons.
 
The Waco, Texas case involved the execution of search warrants by ATF
on the Branch Davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession
(automatics, semi-automatics, and machine-guns, in addition to bombs
and other explosives.)  In virtually every gun case, ATF is asked to
trace weapons through its' National Firearms Tracing Center, where
they keep all dealer and Federal firearms license information.  ATF
is the Federal governments' firearms expert and routinely works with
state and local police to execute warrants.  ATF, working with state
and local law enforcement in Texas and the U.S. Attorneys' office
felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally
establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and
thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members
of the Branch Davidians.  In addition, ATF carefully selected a
Sunday morning, knowing from their source, inside, that the men would
be separated from the women and children and not in the area where
it was known that the illegal weapons were stored.
 
As you may be aware by now, Vernon Howell a.k.a. David Koresh
spiritual leader of the Branch Davidians was tipped of the impending
execution of the search warrants.  Unfortunately, ATF lost the
element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves  and
prepare for ATFs' entry into the compound.  Once a hostage situation
presented itself, the ATF asked the FBI to become involved since the
FBI is skilled in hostage negotiations.  In addition, and military
tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and
firepower of the Branch Davidians.
 
Based on what I have learned about ATF's role in the Branch Davidian
raid, I believe the agency acted responsibly.  I am, however, deeply
saddened by the loss of lives of the 4 law enforcement agents who
attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the
cult.  I fully expect the Department of  Treasury to conduct a
thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside
the Department to be headed by the Assistant Secretary for
Enforcement.  In addition, ATF will conduct its' own review of the
Waco operation.  I look forward to reviewing the findings of the
evaluators and hope this situation in Waco will be brought to a quick
and peaceful conclusion.

Buy a cheap launch system, design reusable moon -> lunar orbit

MAGI: 

[Sneak Preview: Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting
 ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous
 _Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which
 most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the
 second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of
 the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi
 to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]

  The Old Persian word magu, rendered in Greek by magos, is of uncertain 
etymology. It may originally have meant ""member of the tribe,"" as in the
Avestan compound mogu-tbish (""hostile to a member of the tribe""). This meaning
would have been further resticted, among the Medes, to ""member of the priestly
tribe"" and perhaps to ""priest"" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term is
probably of Median origin, given that Herodotus mentions the ""Magoi"" as one of
the six tribes of the Medes.
  For a variety of reasons we can consider the Magi to have been members of a
priestly tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persians, they were
responsible for liturgical functions, as well as for maintaining their
knowledge of the holy and the occult. Most likely, the supremacy of the Median
priesthood in western Iran became established during the time of the Median
monarchy that dominated the Persians from the end of the eighth century
through the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyrus the
Great (550 BCE). The Persians were indebted to the Medes for their political
and civil institutions as well. Even if hypotheses have been advanced
concerning the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period
(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. This is
demonstrated by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mentioned by
Darius I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), as well as by
Greek sources. Indeed, Herodotus insists on the idea of the usurpatory power of
the Medes against the Persians through the conspiracy of the Magi.
  The fact that the Magi may have been members of a tribe that handed down the
sacerdotal arts in a hereditary fashion naturally did not exclude the
possibility that some of them undertook secular prefessions. This seems to be
attested by the Elamite tablets at Persepolis.
  There is a theses, put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denies that the Magi
are members of an ethnic group by suggesting that they are simply members of
the priesthood - a priesthood of purely Zoroastrian origin. This thesis is
untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesis that their name is related to the
Avestan term magavan, derived from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, ""gift""), is
not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The meaning of maga can probably be found,
in conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of
purity, or separation of the ""mixture"" of the two opposed principles of spirit
and matter. The maga, which has been erroneously interpreted as ""chorus,"" from
the root mangh, which is said to mean ""sing the magic song"" (Nyberg, 1966) and
has been rendered simply by an expression like unio mystica, seems to be an
ecstatic condition that opens the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though
there may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan terms
magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the
Avestan priesthood. The Avesta ignores the Median or Old Persian term, despite
a recent hypothesis proposed by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscriptions ignore
the Avestan term for ""priest,"" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if this is 
perhaps present in an Achaeminid setting in the Elamite tablets of Persepolis 
(Gershevitch, 1964).
  The term magu has been present in Zoroastrianism throughout its history; the
Pahlavi terms mogh-mard and mobad represent its continuation. The latter in
particular derives from an older form, magupati (""head of the Magi""). During
the Sasanid period (third to seventh centuries CE), which saw the formation of
a hierarchically organized church, the title mobadan mobad (""the high priest of
high priests"") came to be used to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical
hierarchy.
  The Magi practiced consanguineous marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,
khwedodah). They also performed a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of
the corpse to animals and vultures to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.
The corpse was not supposed to decompose, lest it be contaminated by the demons
of putrefaction. This practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian
community and led to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the
Parsis in India. Stone towers, known as dakhmas, were built especially for this
rite. During the time of Herodotus the practice of exposure of the corpse was
in vogue only among the Magi; the Persians generally sprinkled the corpse with
wax, then buried it. The practice was widespread, however, among the peoples
of Central Asia.
  The Magi were the technicians of and experts on worship: it was impossible to
offer sacrifices without the presence of a Magus. During the performance of a
ritual sacrifice, the Magus sang of the theogony (the Magi were possibly the
custodians of a tradition of sacred poetry, but we know nothing about the
relationship of this tradition to the various parts of the Avesta) and was
called upon to interpret dreams and to divine the future. The Magi were also
known for the practice of killing harmful, or ""Ahrimanical,"" animals (khrafstra)
such as snakes and ants. They dressed in the Median style, wearing pants,
tunics, and coats with sleeves. They wore a characteristic head covering of
felt (Gr. tiara) with strips on the sides that could be used to cover the nose
and mouth during rituals to avoid contaminating consecrated objects with their
breath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these caps, in conformity with a tradition
that is probably of Indo-European origin, according to Georges Dumezil, was
that of the priesthood: white.
  In all likelihood, during the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in
possession of a well-defined body of doctrine, and it is probable that they
gradually adopted Zoroastrianism; they were most likely a clergy consisting of
professional priests who were not tied to a rigid orthodoxy but were naturally
inclined to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonetheless, they must have been
jealous guardians of the patrimony of Zorastrian traditions. By virtue of this
they were the educators of the royal princes. The wisest of them was responsible
for teaching the prince the ""magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomazes"" and thus
the ""cult of the gods."" Magi who excelled in other virtues were entrusted with
the education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageous, and
master of himself.
  During the Achaemenid period the Magi maintained a position of great
influence, although they were certainly subordinate to the emperor. Despite
several dramatic events such as the massacre they suffered after the death of
Gaumata the Magian - in which, according to Herodotus (who calls himself
Smerdis), the Persians killed a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -
the Magi nevertheless managed to maintain their influence at court in Media,
in Persia, and in the various regions of the empire where they were stationed
as a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.
  No priesthood of antiquity was more famous than that of the Magi. They were
renowned as followers of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); as the teachers of some of
the greatest Greek thinkers (Pythagoras, Democritus, Plato); as the wise men
who arrived, guided by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in
Bethlehem; and as the propagators of a cult of the sun in India. But they were
also known as the Chaldeans, the priesthood of Babylon, known for its occultism;
this was perhaps the reason that the term magos had a pejorative sense in Greek,
like ""goes,"" ""expert in the magic arts"" (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Indeed, the
Chaldeans were experts in all types of magical arts, especially astrology, and
had a reputation for wisdom as well as knowledge.
  To understand the reasons for such various and sometimes discordant views, it
is necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-called
western Magi, who were later hellenized. In the Achaemenid period both must
have been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the
Iranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in
contact with diverse religious traditions, must have, sooner or later and in
varying degrees, been influenced by syncretic concepts.
  The Greeks were familiar with both kinds of Magi and, depending on their
varying concerns, would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical
historians and geographers, including Herodotus and Strabo, document their
customs, while the philosophers dwell above all on their doctrines: dualism,
belief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology
and eschatology. Those sources most interested in the doctrines of the Magi
even speak of Zarathushtra as a Magus. In doing so they are repeating what the
Magi themselves said from the Median and Achaemenid periods, when they adopted
Zoroastrianism. At that time they embraced Zarathushtra as one of their own and
placed themselves under his venerable name.
  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformations in the
eastern community by the time of the Acheamenids and was already adapting those
elements of the archaic religion that refused to die. It has been said quite
often, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the
Zoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, ""the law-abjuring
daivas""), part of the Avesta, should be attributed to them. (This collection of
texts from various periods is primarily concerned with purificatory rules and
practices.) Nonetheless, the hypothesis is hardly plausible, since the first
chapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen lands created by Ahura Mazda, the
supreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminated by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;
Gathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of
all evil and suffering - does not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the
land of Ragha mentioned in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it
has been noted (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the authors had been Magi the
absence of any reference to western Iranian institutions, including their own
priesthood, would be very strange.
  The Magi were above all the means by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the
corpus of the Avesta have been transmitted to us, from the second half of the
first millennium BCE on. This has been their principal merit. We can attribute
directly to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assumed, known to
us especially from Greek sources and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of
the ninth and tenth centuries CE. According to this formulation, the two poles
of the dualism are no longer, as in the Gathas, Spenta Mainyu (""beneficent
spirit"") and Angra Mainyu (""hostile spirit"") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra
Mainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] This trans-
formation was of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-
astrianism and was most likely determined by the contact of the Magi with the
Mesopotamian religious world. In this new dualism - which was that later known
to the Greeks (Aristotle, Eudemus of Rhodes, Theopompus, and others) - we can
see the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which
we give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]
  Thanks to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi played an enormously
important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra's treachings, as well as in
the definition of the new forms that these would assume historically. Their
natural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also helped the diffusion of
Zoroastrian ideas in the communities of the Iranian diaspora. The Greeks began
to study their doctrines and to take an interest in them (Xanthus of Lydia,
Hermodorus, Aristotle, Theopompus, Hermippus, Dinon), even writing treatises
on the Persian religion, of which only the titles and a few fragments have
survived. In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen as a secular school of
wisdom, and writings on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority
of such prestigious names as Zarathushtra, Ostanes, and Hystaspes, forming an
abundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).
  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptics were a fertile meeting
ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religions, as can be seen in the famous
_Oracles of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian roots are undeniable and which
most likely dates from the beginning of the Christian era, probably the
second century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of
the Future (Saoshyant) was the basis for the story of the coming of the Magi
to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]
  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determining role in the
religious history of Iran. Concerned to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,
1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism as the national religion of
Iran, the priests of Iranian sanctuaries in Media and Persia were able to
establish a true state church, strongly hierarchical and endowed with an
orthodoxy based on the formation of a canon of scriptures. The leading figures
in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar
and Kerder, the persecutors of Mani in the third century.",religion

When I was at the Texas Star Party a few years ago, the sky was so dark
that Venus did, indeed, cause light pollution until it set.

Even if the billboard were dark it could cause a problem.  Imagine observing an

If I remember correctly (Which is always in doubt), Horner's signing
with the Braves was contingent on starting in Atlanta.  I think
he could have gone back to Arizona St. for one more year if he hadn't
signed.  Anyhow, the Braves did try to send him to Richmond once;
it lead to a week-long walkout.  Methinks Horner had no work ethic
before he was drafted, and minor league play wouldn't have helped.
But his raw talent would have gotten him into the ML, and it did

	At the risk of starting the 'my gun is better than yours' flame
war, I must disagree.
	
	There is no secret in handling a Glock.  In fact, it is often
chosen (besides its other merits) because it shoots like a revolver does
basically.  It can limit the training time (read budget $$$) due to the
fact there are no 'external' safties other than the trigger, hence less
training time required. 

	Smith & Wesson (among other types) are chosen due to the fact taht
they do have the external safties (hammer drop,as well as mag drop) which
if properly used have saved many lives when 'Mr. Bad' snatched the gun
from the officer and tried to shoot said officer the gun was on safe and
would not fire.  This point had been made in many articles in various 
gun magazines.  If fact, one author (can't remember who) staged a little
test where he had a revolver and a S&W on safe laying on a table and asked
people with little firearms experience to on his signal, grab the gun and
shoot a target.  He timed the people using each gun.  The revolver times
were pretty close, but some of the times with the S&W were in minutes, or
the person just gave up because they could not figure out the saftey.

	You don't often see Colt 45 autos issued due to the light trigger
which can be accidentally fired in a stress situation, opening the issuing
city,county, etc.. to lawsuits, bad press, etc..

	Of course any problem can be overcome with enough training, but
such training is not always available to budget crunched departments.  I
know if I were a Cop I would want something like a S&W just for the off
chance of the gun getting taken away.  The safety doesn't guarantee that
'Mr. Bad' won't figure it out and shoot me, but it could buy enough time
to draw a second gun and shoot 'Mr. Bad' before it's too late.

	Don't think I am too biassed here just because I have had 3 Glocks
in my possession at one time, because I have had a .45 as well.  In fact,
it was my first handgun.  Remember, the ultimate 'safety' is YOU the
operator, and no safety is going to stop an negligent discharge (note I
don't say accidental) if you break the rules of gun handling.

	As per the part of being light weight and looking cool, I agree
100%.  I wouldn't rule it out as a first purchase.  ",politics

As I'm sure others will have pointed out to you by now, none of the above
measures are required for you *on your own property*.  You do not have to
have a license, your car does not have to be registered or inspected, and
you do not have to have insurance or safety training classes, when you own
and operate that vehicle on your own premises.  If you are going to make use
of this dubious analogy, at least make it accurate.  And by the way, in Texas
you can drive a car in public (with the proper credentials), but an ordinary
civilian can't carry a gun legally in public to save his/her life.

So I won't even consider registration, *manadatory* safety classes, or
*manadatory* liability insurance unless I get a federal law repealing
all local, state, and federal gun control laws which abridge the Second
Amendment, and a non-discretionary federal weapons carry permit, good
anywhere in the United States.  Come on, you wanted the analogy.

Subject: Gun Stats & Mortal Risks
Date: Mon, 15 Feb 1993 18:35:05 -0500 (EST)


Folks,

Hail from the nether world.  On February 4th, the Wall Street Journal
carried a front-page article by Erik Larson entitled ""Armed Force.""  I
felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat
that ""A Gun is 43 times more likely to kill than to protect.""  I sent
the following to the WSJ.

-----

Gun Stats & Mortal Risks

Preston K. Covey


	Erik Larson~s even-handed article on Paxton Quigley (~Armed Force,~
2/4/93, WSJ) cites the world~s most notorious ~statistic~ regarding guns
in the home:  ~A pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in King
County, Washington, found that a gun in the home was 43 times more
likely to be used to kill its owner, spouse, a friend or child than to
kill an intruder.~  The ~43 times~ stat is everywhere these days;  it
has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth: it was inflated
by one pugilistic talk-show pundit to ~93.~  Given the shock value of
the finding, the conclusion of the 1986 New England Journal of Medicine
(NEJM) study is remarkably understated:  ~The advisability of keeping
firearms in the home for protection must be questioned.~ 
 
	Responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of
bringing a firearm into their home.   But what we need to know is this: 
What exactly are the risks and benefits?  The NEJM testimony is neither
the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the
risks.  Further, as with motor vehicles, we want to know:  What control
do we have over the risks and benefits?  And, as with the risks of
cancer or heart disease or auto accidents:  How can we minimize the
risks?  Like raw highway death tolls, the NEJM stat is not very helpful
here. 

	The NEJM finding purports to inform us, but it is framed to warn us
off.  It is widely promulgated in the media as a ~scare stat,~ a
misleading half-truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice
and terrify.  The frightful statistic screams for itself:  The risks far
outweigh the benefits, yes?   What fool would run these risks?   If your
car were 43 times more likely to kill you, a loved one, a dear friend or
an innocent child than to get you to your destination,  should you not
take the bus?  

	Uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company
of lies and damned lies.   Surely, we can do better where lives are at
stake.   Let~s take a closer look at this risky business:

	The ~43 times~ stat of the NEJM study is the product of dividing the
number of home intruders/aggressors justifiably killed in self-defense
(the divisor) into the number of family members or acquaintances  killed
by a gun in the home (the dividend).  The divisor of this risk equation
is 9: in the study~s five-year sample there were 2 intruders and 7 other
cases of self-defense.  The dividend is 387:  in the study there were 12
accidental deaths, 42 criminal homicides, and 333 suicides.  387 divided
by 9 yields 43.  There were a total of 743 gun-related deaths in King
County between 1978 and 1983,  so the study leaves 347 deaths outside of
homes unaccounted.

	The NEJM~s notorious ~43 times~ statistic is seriously misleading on
six counts:

	1.  The dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media:  the ~or
acquaintances~ of the study (who include your friendly drug dealers and
neighborhood gang members) is equated to ~friends.~  The implication is
that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members,
dear friends, and innocent children.  Deaths may all be equally tragic,
but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are
relevant to the risk.  These crucial risk factors are masked by the
calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless
Waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors.  This is
criminological hogwash.

	2.   The study itself does not distinguish households or environs
populated by people with violent, criminal, or substance-abuse histories
-- where the risk of death is very high -- versus households inhabited
by more civil folk (for example, people who avoid high-risk activities
like drug dealing, gang banging and wife beating) -- where the risk is
very low indeed.  In actuality, negligent adults allow fatal but
avoidable accidents; and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with
histories of violence or abuse, people who are identifiably and
certifiably at ~high risk~ for misadventure.  To ignore these obvious
risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as
ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths: by tautology, neither
gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or
vehicles; but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver
crucially affect the risk. 

	3.  One misleading implication of the way the NEJM stat is framed is
that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill
than to protect, and this obscures -- indeed, disregards -- the role of
personal responsibility.  The typical quotation of this study (unlike
Larson~s) attributes fatal agency to the gun:  ~A gun in the home is 43
times as likely to kill . . . .~  (The Center to Prevent Handgun
Violence, a major promulgator of the NEJM statistic, uses this
particular formulation.)  We can dispense with the silly debate about
whether it~s people or guns that accomplish the killing:  again, by
tautology, gun  deaths would not occur without the guns.  The question
begged is how many deaths would occur anyway, without the guns.  In any
case, people are the death-dealing agents, the guns are their lethal
instruments.  The moral core of the personal  risk factors in gun deaths
are personal responsibility and choice.  Due care and responsibility
obviate gun accidents; human choice mediates homicide and suicide (by
gun or otherwise).  The choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to
NEJM~s high-risk pool.  The gun does not create this risk by itself. 
People have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their
homes.  For example, graduates of Paxton Quigley~s personal protection
course do not run the touted ~43 times~ risk any more than skilled and
sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death
as do reckless or drunk drivers.  Undiscriminating actuarials disregard
and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice, just as they
disregard and obscure the role of socio-economic, criminological and
other risk-relevant factors in firearm-related death.  This is why we
resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose
norms disregard our individualities.  Fortunately, nothing can consign
us to the NEJM risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in
the matter.

	4.  Suicide accounts for 84% of the deaths by gun in the home in the
NEJM study.  As against the total deaths by gun in King County,
including those outside the home, in-house suicides are 44% of the total
death toll, which is closer to the roughly 50% proportion found by other
studies.  Suicide is a social problem of a very different order from
homicide or accidents.  The implication of the NEJM study is that these
suicides might not occur without readily available guns.  It is true
that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed.  It is not obviously
true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these
suicides.  This is widely assumed or alleged, but the preponderance of
research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise, that this is
wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases.  (See:  Bruce
L. Danto et al., The Human Side of Homicide,  Columbia University Press,
1982;  Charles Rich et al.,  ~Guns and Suicide,~  American Journal of
Psychiatry,  March 1990.)  If suicides were removed from the dividend of
the NEJM study~s risk equation, the ~43 times~ stat would deflate to
~six.~  The inclusion of suicides in the NEJM risk equation -- like the
causes, durability, or interdiction of suicidal intent itself -- is a
profoundly debatable matter.  Quotations of the NEJM study totally
disregard this issue.

	5.  Citations of the NEJM study also mislead regarding the estimable
rate of justifiable and excusable homicide.  Most measures, like the
NEJM homicide rate, are based on the immediate disposition of cases. 
But many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled
self-defense.  In the literature on battered women, immediate case
dispositions are notorious for under-representing the rate of
justifiable or excusable homicide. Time~s January 18, 1993, cover story
on women ~Fighting Back~ reported one study~s finding that 40% of women
who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out.  Time~s July 17,
1989, cover story on a week of gun deaths reported 51% of the domestic
cases as shootings by abuse victims; but only 3% of the homicides were
reported as self-defense.  In a May 14, 1990, update, Time  reported
that 12% of the homicides had eventually been ruled self-defense. In
Time~s sample, the originally reported rate of self-defense was in error
by a factor of four.  The possibility of such error is not acknowledged
by promulgators of the NEJM statistic. 

	6.  While both the dividend and the product of the NEJM risk equation
are arguably inflated, the divisor is unconscionably misleading.  The
divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed,  not
aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even
shot at.   The utility of armed self-defense is the other side of the
coin from the harms done with guns in homes.  What kind of moral idiocy
is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings ?  Do we measure
the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed  -- as
opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled, apprehended, or
deterred?  Should we not celebrate (let alone count ) those cases where
no human life is lost as successful armed defenses?  The question posed
to media that cite the NEJM scare stat is this:  Why neglect the
compendious research on successful armed defense, notably by
criminologist Gary Kleck (Point Blank: Guns and Violence in America ,
Aldine de Gruyter, 1992)?
	Kleck~s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are
based on victimization surveys as well as other studies:  the rate is
high (about one million a year) and the risk is good (gun defenders fare
better than anyone, either those who resort to other forms of resistance
or those who do not resist).  Dividing one million gun defenses a year
by 30,000 annual gun deaths (from self-defense, homicides, suicides, and
accidents) yields 33.  Thus, we can construct a much more favorable
statistic than the NEJM scare stat:  

A gun is 33 times more likely to be used to defend against assault or
other crime than to kill anybody.   

	Of course, Kleck~s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation;
what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control.  We
should indeed question the basis and method of Kleck~s high estimation
of defensive firearm use, as I have questioned the NEJM statistic. 
Clearly, the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by
uncritical citation of statistics.   One thing troubles me still:  we
can hardly escape the unquestioned NEJM scare stat in our media,  but we
hardly ever find Kleck~s good work mentioned,  even critically.

"Excerpts from netnews.talk.politics.guns: 18-Apr-93 2ND AMENDMENT DEAD -
GOOD ! by jrm@gnv.ifas.ufl.edu 

excerpted from a letter I wrote a while ago:

     Although less apparent to those who have not researched
the facts, personal protection is as legitimate a reason  as
sport for the private citizen to own a gun.  The most recent
research  is  that  of Dr. Gary Kleck of the  Florida  State
University  School of Criminology.1  He found that  handguns
are  more  often  used by victims to defeat  crime  than  by
criminals to commit it (645,000 vs. 580,000 respectively  in
this  study).  These figures are even more encouraging  when
you  consider the number of crimes that never occur  because
of  the  presence  of a gun in the hands  of  a  law-abiding
private  citizen.  In a National Institute of Justice  study
of  ten state prisons across the country they found that 39%
of  the  felons  surveyed had aborted  at  least  one  crime
because  they believed that the intended victim was  armed.,
and  57% agreed that ""most criminals are more worried  about
meeting an armed victim than they are about running into the
police.""2
     One  of the most heinous of crimes is that against  the
women  of  this country.  It has been my recent  observation
that  more  women  are purchasing handguns  for  defense  in
response  to  the  present danger of these  assaults.   This
should be taken as encouraging news if the events of Orlando
Florida  are any indicator.  In the late 1960's  the  female
populace was plagued with a series of brutal assaults;  just
the  publicity of the record number of women buying guns and
obtaining training resulted in an 88% decrease in  rape  for
that  area,  the  only city of its size in  the  country  to
experience a decrease of crime for that year.  Additionally,
a 1979 US Justice Department study of 32,000 attempted rapes
showed  that overall, when rape is attempted, the completion
rate  is 36%. But when a woman defends herself with  a  gun,
the completion rate drops to 3%.

SPACECRAFT

1.  On April 19, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer
(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

2.  On April 19, a Command Detector Unit Signal-to-Noise Ratio (CDUSNR) test
and a Radio Frequency Subsystem Automatic Gain Control (RFSAGC) test were
performed using the LGA-1 (Low Gain Antenna #1) over DSS-63 (Madrid 70 meter
antenna) and DSS-61 (Madrid 34 meter antenna), respectively.  Data analysis
is in process.  These tests are periodically performed to provide detailed
information relative to the telecom command hardware integrity.

3.  On April 19, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss timer to
264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.

4.  On April 21, the first of two suppressed carrier/DSN (Deep Space Network)
advanced receiver characterization tests was performed over DSS-14 (Goldstone
70 meter antenna).  The spacecraft modulation index was varied from 43 degrees
to 90 degrees for a range of ground receiver bandwidth settings.

5.  The AC bus imbalance measurement has not exhibited significant change
(greater than 25 DN) throughout this period but the DC bus imbalance
measurement has.  The AC measurement reads 20 DN (4.5 volts).  The DC
measurement has ranged from 43 DN (4.6 volts) to 138 DN (16.2 volts) and
currently reads 138 DN (16.2 volts).  These measurements are consistent with
the model developed by the AC/DC special anomaly team.

6.  The Spacecraft status as of April 22, 1993, is as follows:

I'm still catching up from Spring Break, but bear with me...



Javy Lopez has proven, over 1400+ AB in the minor leagues, that he is
ready to play in the majors. He is *not* being rushed. Players who are
clearly too good for AA and play behind stiffs at the major league level
are wasting their time, and may actually have a court case against
major league management for keeping them, at AAA.


Unless Lopez is *me* defensively (I'm 5'7'', 165 and born to play
second base :-)), he belongs in the major leagues.


Valentine isn't saying he should back up. He's saying he should be put
in a position to *win* the job in the major leagues, which, IMHO, he
would if given the opportunity. (Val, if I'm misinterpreting, please
let me know.)



But the players who *are* ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones most
likely to benefit from being in the majors. Javy Lopez is not a middle-
of-the-road prospect. He's the real thing. NOW. 

Again, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does that
miles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough for
Greenville, or Richmond, it's good enough for Atlanta. If he really was
awful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed.


Oh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players.
Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really
aren't very good at baseball. Think of it as ""TWG"" without the caps.
It's a losing strategy to say, ""We have solid guys, we don't need to improve.""
You used it four times in that paragraph, BTW.

Same for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and Damon
Berryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years,
Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference,
IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast.

""Two big bats."" Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing.
Call it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither player
has *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RH
are awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. Pendleton has wasted
too much bandwidth already. If the CF platoon hits .300, I'll retrace
Mr. Likhani's midnight run down Forbes, and I live in NY and LA.
(Got that, Mike?)

And doesn't Cox call pitches, anyway?


Nope. They're baseball management, possible the most short-sighted 
collection of people in the nation. Do you not believe this goes on,
Mark? Do you think Frank Thomas needed those three months in AAA in
1990? Or Cal Eldred wasn't *really* better than Ricky Bones last year?

Good I had a bad feeling about this problem because of a special case
with no solution that worried me.

Four coplanar points in the shape of a square have no unique sphere 
that they are on the surface of.
Similarly 4 colinear point have no finite sized sphere that they are on the
surface of.

These algorithms being geometrical designed rather than algebraically design
meet these problems neatly.

When determining which plane the 3 points are on if they are colinear
the algorithm should afil or return infinite R.
When intersecting the two lines there are 2 possibilities
they are the same line  (the 4 points were on a planar circle)
they are different lines but parallel. There is a sphere of in radius.

This last case can be achieved with 3 colinier points and any 4th point
by taking the 4th point and pairs of the first 3 parallel lines will be produced

it can also be achieved by

If all 4 points are coplanar but are not on one circle. 

It seems to me that the algorithm only fails when the 4 points are coplanar.
The algorithm always fails when the points are coplanar.
(4 points being colinear => coplanar)

Testing if the 4th point is coplanar when the plane of the first 3 points
has been found is trivial.

"Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and
related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can 
predict a player's RBIs using information about his overall
performance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP)
that he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated
predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This 
completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 
could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd
take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to
the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.

I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that
I've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and
b) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.
That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't 
have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you
run a simple least squares fit to the data you get 

(RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.

The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is
significant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the
fit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to 
the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,
Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to 
add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.

It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the
low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it
could just be Ozzie.  The results:

                           RBI-HR
         Years        Actual   Predicted
Carter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6
Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6
Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8
Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6

I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that
RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall
and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.

"About a year ago I started work on a problem that appeared to
be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult.  I am wondering if
anyone on the net has seen this problem and (hopefully) some published 
solutions to it.

	The problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two
roughly parallel cubic splines.  For inputs the problem essentially
starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the 
edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional, i.e. only extant
between the edges, but which exists in three dimensional space.  To draw 
the object we 

1) fit a cubic spline through the points.  Each spline is effectively
	computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the
        curve.  Each spline has an equal number of segments.  We assume
	that the nth segment along each spline is roughly, but not
	exactly, the same distance along each spline by any reasonable
	measure.
2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment
	of the opposing spline.  Use the pair of segments to form two
	triangles which will be filled in to color the surface.
3) Depth sort the triangles
4) Take each triangle in sorted order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw
	and color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that is
	along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge
	colored with a special ""edge color""

	It is the edge coloring in step 4 that is at the heart of the
problem.  The idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface.
The net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in
the edge of the surface.  The reasons for this are fairly complicated.
They involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting
from the projecting the splines.  If anything about this problem
sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this
area.",graphics

"So far Simmons looks like a total idiot.


1) Zane Smith should learn how to ""switchpitch"" and return from the DL. I
would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.

2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an
impressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's
reputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the
AL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he
pitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.

3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.
BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have
shown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little
bit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.
Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at
the plate in his rookie year.

4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that
Walk desrved his contract.

5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I
can't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through
waivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.
Not a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him
way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught
should have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed
pitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to
trade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere
wasn't very fit last year.

6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!
7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the
season. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other
than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,
Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have
pitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money
on Patterson in stead.

8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.

9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.
10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his
value has increased immensely.

11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.
Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.
Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better
than a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.

12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement
in favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that
idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.
13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The
RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace
two of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a
very respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have
a respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit
left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options
for the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was
getting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.

14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.
they will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.
Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,
nothing else will.

On a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2
starts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of
the season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the
season, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked
in the second half of the last 2 seasons)>

     What  evidence  indicates that Gamma Ray bursters are very far away?

Their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution,
crudely speaking, indicates we're seeing an edge to the distribution.

   Given the enormous  power,  i was just wondering,  what if they are
   quantum  black holes or something  like that  fairly close by?

   Why would they have to be at  galactic ranges?   

Now, in the good old days before GRO data, it was thought the
gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy, it was expected that
GRO would confirm this by either showing they were a local population
(within a few hundred light years) or that they were in the galactic
halo. (Mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed)
(also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was
probably in the LMC, suggesting theorists might be wrong back then...)
	As the Sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo
population should show anisotropy (a local disk population is
ruled out completely at this stage) - to avoid the anisotropy you
have to push the halo out, the energy then gets large, the mechanism
of getting NS out that far becomes questionable, and we should start
to see for example the Andromeda's bursters.
	The data is consistent with either a Oort cloud distribution
(but only just) - but no one can think of a plausible source with
the right spectrum. Or, it can be a cosmological distances (hence
isotropy) and the edge is ""the edge of the Universe"" ;-)
If at cosmological distances you need very high energy (to detect)
and a very compact source (for spectrum), ergo a neutron star
colliding with another neutron star or black hole. Even then getting
the spectrum is very hard, but conceivable.

	If we know anything about physics at that level,
the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic
strings, wrong spectrum for one thing.

The situation is further complicated by recent claims that
there are two classes of sources ;-)  [in the colliding NS
they'd actually probably fit relatively easily into the
NS-NS and NS-BH collision scenarios respectively]

   my own pet theory is that it's  Flying saucers  entering
   hyperspace :-)

   but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes  that they
   are  colliding nuetron stars  or  spinning black holes,  i just wondered
   if any mechanism could exist  and place them  closer in.

If you can think of one, remember to invite me to Stockholm...",space

"The primary problem in human nature is a ""fragmentation of being.""
Humans are in a state of tension, a tension of opposites. Good and
evil are the most thought provoking polarities that come to mind.

The Bible provides us with many examples of the fragmentation of
being. The warring opposites within us are a product of man's
rebellion against God, which is described so vividly in the pages of
the Scriptures.

Man was created with the order to become a god. Those were the words
of St.  Basil in the fourth century. What he was trying to say was
that God created man to be a partaker of the divine nature. In the
Eastern Orthodox Church, this is called ""theosis,"" or ""deification.""

One can also say that man was created to be whole, i.e. spirit, soul,
and body operating in unison. The story of Adam and Eve is a picture
of the archetypal humans before obtaining moral consciousness. Theirs
was a harmonious relationship with each other, the world, and the
Creator. That innocent harmony was shattered when they disobeyed God,
their natural wholeness falling apart into two seemingly
irreconcilable halves. Immediately, guilt and fear was manifested in
their lives. They become bound to hardship, toil, and suffering.  This
is symbolized in their exile from the paradisiac state.

The beast in the jungle does not possess moral consciousness. If it
were to receive this self-awareness, the knowledge of good and evil,
its paradisiac state would also be destroyed.

Was it the intention of the Creator to leave man in this state of
innocence all the days of his existence on earth? Or was the gaining
of self-awareness carefully staged by God, who did not desire that His
masterpiece, mankind, be a blissful idiot?

God must have known that, for mankind to achieve any kind of moral
value, he must pass through a confrontation with the opposites. There
is no other way to achieve union with God.

Jesus Christ is the answer to the problem of the warring polarities.
He was the perfectly integrated individual, reconciling the opposites,
and making it possible for us to be integrated, i.e. to become God,
not in His essence, but in His energies.

The opposites is THE Christian problem. The Apostle Paul describes it
with the utmost precision in Romans 7:15-24. And he follows with the
answer to his dilemma in vs 25.",religion

"Forwarded from Neal Ausman, Galileo Mission Director

                                GALILEO
                     MISSION DIRECTOR STATUS REPORT
                             POST-LAUNCH
                         April 9 - 15, 1993

SPACECRAFT

1.  On April 9, real-time commands were sent, as planned, to reacquire
celestial reference after completion of the Low Gain Antenna (LGA-2)
swing/Dual Drive Actuator (DDA) hammer activities.

2.  On April 9, the EJ-1 (Earth-Jupiter #1) sequence memory load was uplinked
to the spacecraft without incident.  This sequence covers spacecraft activity
from April 12, 1993 to June 14, 1993 and includes a window for the Radio Relay
Antenna (RRA) slew test on April 28, 1993.  The command loss timer was set to
11 days as a part of this sequence memory load.

3.  On April 12 and 15, a NO-OP command was sent to reset the command loss
timer to 264 hours, its planned value during this mission phase.

4.  On April 12, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV), Dust Detector (DDS), and Magnetometer
(MAG) instruments.  Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received
properly.

5.  On April 12, an Ultra-Stable Oscillator (USO) test was performed to verify
the health status of the USO and to collect gravitational red shift experiment
data; long term trend analysis is continuing.

6.  On April 14, a 40bps modulation index test was performed to determine the
optimal Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) when transmitting at 40bps.  Preliminary
analysis of the data suggests that the present pre-launch selected modulation
index is near the optimal level.

7.  On April 15, cruise science Memory Readouts (MROs) were performed for the
Extreme Ultraviolet Spectrometer (EUV) and Magnetometer (MAG) instrument.
Preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly.

8.  On April 15, a periodic RPM (Retro-Propulsion Module) 10-Newton thruster
flushing maintenance activity was performed; all 12 thrusters were flushed
during the activity.  Thruster performance throughout the activity was nominal.

9.  The AC/DC bus imbalance measurements have not exhibited significant
changes (greater than 25 DN) throughout this period.  The AC measurement reads
19 DN (4.3 volts).  The DC measurement reads 111 DN (12.9 volts).  These
measurements are consistent with the model developed by the AC/DC special
anomaly team.

10. The Spacecraft status as of April 15, 1993, is as follows:

       a)  System Power Margin -  60 watts
       b)  Spin Configuration - Dual-Spin
       c)  Spin Rate/Sensor - 3.15rpm/Star Scanner
       d)  Spacecraft Attitude is approximately 18 degrees
           off-sun (lagging) and 6 degrees off-earth (leading)
       e)  Downlink telemetry rate/antenna- 40bps(coded)/LGA-1
       f)  General Thermal Control - all temperatures within
           acceptable range
       g)  RPM Tank Pressures - all within acceptable range
       h)  Orbiter Science- Instruments powered on are the PWS,
           EUV, UVS, EPD, MAG, HIC, and DDS
       i)  Probe/RRH - powered off, temperatures within
           acceptable range
       j)  CMD Loss Timer Setting - 264 hours
           Time To Initiation - 260 hours


GDS (Ground Data Systems):

1.  Galileo participated in a second DSN (Deep Space Network) acceptance test
for the DSN Telemetry Phase 3 Upgrade on April 13, 1993, using CTA-21
(Compatibility Test Area 21).  The purpose of this test was to verify
the flow of Galileo telemetry data through the new Telemetry Group Controller
(TGC) and the Telemetry Channel Assembly (TCA).  The TGC/TCA is the replacement
for the current Telemetry Processing Assembly (TPA).  Seven different telemetry
rates were run for this test; all ran well on both the MTS (MCCC Telemetry
Subsystem) and the AMMOS MGDS V18.0 GIF with the exception of 10bps.  The
10bps rate had some trouble staying in lock; it appears the TGC/TCA was
not metering the data correctly.  Further comparisons between the MGDS and MTS
data from this test are being conducted. MVT (Mission Verification Test) of
the TGC/TCA system is expected to begin May 16, 1993.


TRAJECTORY

     As of noon Thursday, April 15, 1993, the Galileo Spacecraft trajectory
status was as follows:

	Distance from Earth         152,606,000 km (1.02 AU)
	Distance from Sun           277,519,800 km (1.86 AU)
	Heliocentric Speed          93,400 km per hour
	Distance from Jupiter       543,973,900 km
	Round Trip Light Time       17 minutes, 4 seconds

"I thought I'd post my predicted standings since I find those posted by others
to be interesting.  Sorry this is after Opening Day.  I certify that these
were completed before the first pitch. :-)

AL East
1.  New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division
2.  Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris?  No way.
3.  Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect
4.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop
5.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing
6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak
7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th

Al West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top
          4 gets pitching should win it.
1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success
2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco?
3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching.
4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close
5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here
6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs
7.  California Angels - will win no games

NL East
1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach!
2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga
3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected
4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a ""team""
5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me
6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing
7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing

NL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division.
1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern
2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all
3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2
4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993
5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants
6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink
7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.


NLCS  Montreal d. Atlanta  (Braves fans, yes I'm probably contradicting
                            what I said in my NL West comment.)
ALCS  New York d. Minnesota

World Series  New York d. Montreal - Hating the Yankees will be
                                     fashionable again

NL MVP:  Barry Bonds, or maybe McGriff
NL Cy Young:  Jose Rijo
AL MVP:  Frank Thomas will deserve it (again), but Fielder might win it
AL Cy Young:  Roger Clemens (at least will deserve it (again))

  The same Bill James? Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting 
Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire;
he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't
all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when
everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy
Campanella. 


  Which reports are those? 


  I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play
him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter.
Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez
will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they
play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching
tandem.  


  I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher
defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from
your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is
opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.
Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases. 

  As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big
bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that
they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard
plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak 
defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of
Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich
Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have. 
I'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative.

I don't have a history handy, but I don't recall that the preponderance
of ROY's come from winning teams.  In fact, I think team performance is
generally irrelevant, as almost always the most deserving candidate wins.
Am I wrong?

And he is not necessarily on a losing team.  While the Angels' staff
is still very weak, their everyday lineup is doing quite well, thank
you.  Snow is playing great.  Salmon is learning to make the adjustments.
Easley appears fine, but even if he's not Flora is ready to come up.
Between Gonzales and Gruber they'll manage the hot corner.  Polonia
and Curtis are steady and heady.  Even Myers and Orton are contributing.

Personally, I think they can finish over .500 which makes them a 
winning team.

losing this guy, who's been in AAA most of the last 5 seasons.  The Pirates
released Kirk Gibson last year because Prince was out of options, then
eventually sent Prince down anyway, and he cleared waivers without a peep.
He's another year older, and still can't hit; why do they think he wouldn't

The problem is, your use of the word ""objective"" along with ""values.""
Both definitions three and four are inherently subjective, that is
they are particular to a given individual, or personal. You see,
what one person may see as worthwhile, another may see as worthless.


Again, your form of measurement in this sentence, that being of ""worth""
is subjective. 



When I find that my usage of a word is different than the usage of
that word given by another person, I try to find a standard against
which to judge that usage. In most cases, the dictionary is the standard
I use. Here is a definiton of objective:

objective ADJ. 1. Of or having to do with a material object as 
distinguished from a mental concept. 2. Having actual existance.
3.a. Unenfluenced by emotion or personal prejudice. b. Based on
observable phenomenon.

By this definition, science does not have an objective worth, since the
phrase ""objective worth"" is an oxymoron. However you asked something a 
little differently this time, you asked for an objective basis for a
notion. The fact that the use of science as an intellectual tool is
responsible for changes in our world (the changes are material, and
thus ""objective"") would provide an objective _basis_ for an argument.
However, the conclusion arrived at from that argument (that science is 
""good"") is subjective.

I think that the problem here is one of word usage. Take a little time
and read the definitions of these words: objective, subjective, worth,
value, morality, good, evil. I believe that if you think about the 
meaning of them for a while, you will have to conclude that there is no
such thing as an objective morality.

We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu-
tion  from the rest of the team's.  There is only one way of determin-
ing ""best"" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at
the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best
that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the
most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the
best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-
cess  used to determine the ""best"" is the score of the game and it re-
lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method
inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that
is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.

To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-
solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B
in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.

If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has
done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you
have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the
individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the
only measure of ""best"" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-
ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-
pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-
jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can
predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.


Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with
Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.
I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally
meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on
his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.


You don't have to be rude.


For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point
of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio
Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because
he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed
that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an
individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of
comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-
formance.

The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new
knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better
than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less 
incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.

The Command Loss Timer is a timer that does just what its name says;
it indicates to the probe that it has lost its data link for receiving
commands.  Upon expiration of the Command Loss Timer, I believe the
probe starts a 'search for Earth' sequence (involving antenna pointing
and attitude changes which consume fuel) to try to reestablish
communications.  No-ops are sent periodically through those periods
when there are no real commands to be sent, just so the probe knows
that we haven't forgotten about it.

Hope that's clear enough to be comprehensible.

You must be using 'values' to mean something different from the way I
see it used normally.

And you are certainly using 'Science' like that if you equate it to
""the real world"".

Science is the recognition of patterns in our perceptions of the Universe
and the making of qualitative and quantitative predictions concerning
those perceptions.

It has nothing to do with values as far as I can see.
Values are ... well they are what I value.
They are what I would have rather than not have - what I would experience
rather than not, and so on.

Objective values are a set of values which the proposer believes are
applicable to everyone.


I don't agree.
Science is useful insofar as it the predictions mentioned above are
accurate.  That is insofar as what I think *will be* the effect on
my perceptions of a time lapse (with or without my input to the Universe)
versus what my perceptions actually turn out to be.

But values are about whether I like (in the loosest sense of the word) the 
perceptions :-)


I don't see why.
'Usefulness' in science is synonomous with 'accuracy' - period.
Tarot predictions are not useful because they are not accurate - or
can't be shown to be accurate.
Science is useful because it is apparently accurate.

Values - objective or otherwise - are beside the point.

Well, pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than just
tugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying
to recover the energy from this process (which is at least trying to
go the 'right' way on the energy curve).  Now, where *did* I put those
sackcloth and ashes?

[I was not and am not 'pretending' anything; I am *so* pleased you are
not surprised, though.]


Note that I didn't say it was perpetual motion, or even that it
sounded like perpetual motion; the phrase was ""sounds almost like
perpetual motion"", which I, at least, consider a somewhat different
propposition than the one you elect to criticize.  Perhaps I should
beg your pardon for being *too* precise in my use of language?


I will believe that this process comes even close to approaching
technological and economic feasibility (given the mixed nature of the
trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of
separating things first and having a different 'run' for each
actinide) when I see them dump a few tons in one end and pull
(relatively) clean material out the other.  Once the costs,
technological risks, etc., are taken into account I still class this
one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun.  Sure, it's possible
and the physics are well understood, but is it really a reasonable
approach? 

And I still wonder at what sort of 'burning' rate you could get with
something like this, as opposed to what kind of energy you would
really recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power
with and without the energy recovery.  Are we talking ounces, pounds,
or tons (grams, kilograms, or metric tons, for you SI fans) of
material and are we talking days, weeks, months, or years (days,
weeks, months or years, for you SI fans -- hmmm, still using a
non-decimated time scale, I see  ;-))?

UPCOMING PLANETARY PROBES - MISSIONS AND SCHEDULES

    Information on upcoming or currently active missions not mentioned below
    would be welcome. Sources: NASA fact sheets, Cassini Mission Design
    team, ISAS/NASDA launch schedules, press kits.


    ASUKA (ASTRO-D) - ISAS (Japan) X-ray astronomy satellite, launched into
    Earth orbit on 2/20/93. Equipped with large-area wide-wavelength (1-20
    Angstrom) X-ray telescope, X-ray CCD cameras, and imaging gas
    scintillation proportional counters.


    CASSINI - Saturn orbiter and Titan atmosphere probe. Cassini is a joint
    NASA/ESA project designed to accomplish an exploration of the Saturnian
    system with its Cassini Saturn Orbiter and Huygens Titan Probe. Cassini
    is scheduled for launch aboard a Titan IV/Centaur in October of 1997.
    After gravity assists of Venus, Earth and Jupiter in a VVEJGA
    trajectory, the spacecraft will arrive at Saturn in June of 2004. Upon
    arrival, the Cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an
    orbit around Saturn. Near the end of this initial orbit, the Huygens
    Probe separates from the Orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of
    Titan. The Orbiter relays the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hours
    while the Probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the
    surface. After the completion of the Probe mission, the Orbiter
    continues touring the Saturnian system for three and a half years. Titan
    synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of Titan and
    targeted flybys of Iapetus, Dione and Enceladus. The objectives of the
    mission are threefold: conduct detailed studies of Saturn's atmosphere,
    rings and magnetosphere; conduct close-up studies of Saturn's
    satellites, and characterize Titan's atmosphere and surface.

    One of the most intriguing aspects of Titan is the possibility that its
    surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that
    result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere. These
    hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain
    down onto the surface. The Cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to
    peer through Titan's clouds and determine if there is liquid on the
    surface. Experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will
    investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere.

    The Cassini mission is named for Jean Dominique Cassini (1625-1712), the
    first director of the Paris Observatory, who discovered several of
    Saturn's satellites and the major division in its rings. The Titan
    atmospheric entry probe is named for the Dutch physicist Christiaan
    Huygens (1629-1695), who discovered Titan and first described the true
    nature of Saturn's rings.

    GALILEO - Jupiter orbiter and atmosphere probe, in transit. Has returned
    the first resolved images of an asteroid, Gaspra, while in transit to
    Jupiter. Efforts to unfurl the stuck High-Gain Antenna (HGA) have
    essentially been abandoned. JPL has developed a backup plan using data
    compression (JPEG-like for images, lossless compression for data from
    the other instruments) which should allow the mission to achieve

    HITEN - Japanese (ISAS) lunar probe launched 1/24/90. Has made
    multiple lunar flybys. Released Hagoromo, a smaller satellite,
    into lunar orbit. This mission made Japan the third nation to
    orbit a satellite around the Moon.


    MAGELLAN - Venus radar mapping mission. Has mapped almost the entire
    surface at high resolution. Currently (4/93) collecting a global gravity
    map.


    MARS OBSERVER - Mars orbiter including 1.5 m/pixel resolution camera.
    Launched 9/25/92 on a Titan III/TOS booster. MO is currently (4/93) in
    transit to Mars, arriving on 8/24/93. Operations will start 11/93 for
    one martian year (687 days).


    TOPEX/Poseidon - Joint US/French Earth observing satellite, launched
    8/10/92 on an Ariane 4 booster. The primary objective of the
    TOPEX/POSEIDON project is to make precise and accurate global
    observations of the sea level for several years, substantially
    increasing understanding of global ocean dynamics. The satellite also
    will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean.


    ULYSSES- European Space Agency probe to study the Sun from an orbit over
    its poles. Launched in late 1990, it carries particles-and-fields
    experiments (such as magnetometer, ion and electron collectors for
    various energy ranges, plasma wave radio receivers, etc.) but no camera.

    Since no human-built rocket is hefty enough to send Ulysses far out of
    the ecliptic plane, it went to Jupiter instead, and stole energy from
    that planet by sliding over Jupiter's north pole in a gravity-assist
    manuver in February 1992. This bent its path into a solar orbit tilted
    about 85 degrees to the ecliptic. It will pass over the Sun's south pole
    in the summer of 1993. Its aphelion is 5.2 AU, and, surprisingly, its
    perihelion is about 1.5 AU-- that's right, a solar-studies spacecraft
    that's always further from the Sun than the Earth is!

    While in Jupiter's neigborhood, Ulysses studied the magnetic and
    radiation environment. For a short summary of these results, see
    *Science*, V. 257, p. 1487-1489 (11 September 1992). For gory technical
    detail, see the many articles in the same issue.

    Proposed Missions:
	o Advanced X-ray Astronomy Facility (AXAF)
	    Possible launch from shuttle in 1995, AXAF is a space
	    observatory with a high resolution telescope. It would orbit for
	    15 years and study the mysteries and fate of the universe.

	o Earth Observing System (EOS)
	    Possible launch in 1997, 1 of 6 US orbiting space platforms to
	    provide long-term data (15 years) of Earth systems science
	    including planetary evolution.

	o Mercury Observer
	    Possible 1997 launch.

	o Lunar Observer
	    Possible 1997 launch, would be sent into a long-term lunar
	    orbit. The Observer, from 60 miles above the moon's poles, would
	    survey characteristics to provide a global context for the
	    results from the Apollo program.

	o Space Infrared Telescope Facility
	    Possible launch by shuttle in 1999, this is the 4th element of
	    the Great Observatories program. A free-flying observatory with
	    a lifetime of 5 to 10 years, it would observe new comets and
	    other primitive bodies in the outer solar system, study cosmic
	    birth formation of galaxies, stars and planets and distant
	    infrared-emitting galaxies

	o Mars Rover Sample Return (MRSR)
	    Robotics rover would return samples of Mars' atmosphere and
	    surface to Earch for analysis. Possible launch dates: 1996 for
	    imaging orbiter, 2001 for rover.

	o Fire and Ice
	    Possible launch in 2001, will use a gravity assist flyby of
	    Earth in 2003, and use a final gravity assist from Jupiter in
	    2005, where the probe will split into its Fire and Ice
	    components: The Fire probe will journey into the Sun, taking
	    measurements of our star's upper atmosphere until it is
	    vaporized by the intense heat. The Ice probe will head out
	    towards Pluto, reaching the tiny world for study by 2016.

"Since I was the one responsible for these divergent threads of
approx. 40+ posts (going back to: The Braves could be better off
if an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more
fuel to the flame!

1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though
Lopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still
recovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),
and there were questions as to whether he would be
able to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.

I was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez
can hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was
the Braves ""Defensive Catcher"" prospect, while Brian Deak was
the Braves ""Offensive Catcher"" prospect.  Besides, Olson
and Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard
box, and don't walk enough to be useful.

But Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went
with the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down
at the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.

2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.
After all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and
tear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher
(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to
move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.
Plus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't
tiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill
at $450,000, but that's only what I recall).

3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to
play in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players
aren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster
the longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,
but the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business
standpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the
first time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.

4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.
I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,
and the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,
which, IMO, includes Lopez.

Of course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)

As for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went
like this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)
(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)

Cox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a
little smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding
is better than it used to be.

Schuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion
just won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count
on him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the
defense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on
Billy Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,
we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to
give us some pitching depth in 1995.

Cox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.
OK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having
Berry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about
Klesko?

Schuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil
for Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money
or Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,
but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First
Jeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he
gets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he
and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!

Cox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading
deadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few
extra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...
if Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.
And if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees
could be ""persuaded"" to act up.  There's always the
15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Schuerholz:  What about Caraballo?

Cox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts
in Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be
arbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually
get some value from him before he makes the big bucks.

Schuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.

Cox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson
would recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into
running into him again?

Schuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get
$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one
extra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little
bit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed
hitter.  You know how rare that is?

Cox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,
if you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in
the World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!

Schuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez
into the lineup.

Cox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff
Reardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used
to our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with
them this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely
we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?

Schuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep
will be hurt by May.

Cox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely
one of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I
can call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!
THE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey
Stengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto,
but have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally
get my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!

Schuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those
""happy pills"" left around by Chuck Tanner?  Why'd you
ever hire that guy anyhow?

Cox:  Don't ask me; ask Ted.

   I'm sorry, I thought we were discussing heresy.  I assumed that heresy
meant a departure from orthodoxy, in which case generally accepted belief is
indeed an important issue.  In this case, the definition of the word ""create""
is of great importance, since creation is the issue being discussed.


  I should have said ""given the Mormon belief.""  If you disagree with the
Mormon belief that creation is more a function of organization of eternally
existent substance than one of ex nihilo creation, then that is the important
point.


  Correction: you interpret the Bible to mean something very specific by
such terms.

   It always cracks me up when anti-Mormons presume to tell Mormons what they
believe.  Mormons do, in fact, believe that all people, including Christ and
Lucifer, are children of God in the sense that we were all created (or
organized or whatever) by Him.  We also believe that being ""offspring"" of
God has a symbolic sense when applied to being spiritually ""born again"" of
Him.  Thus the same word can be used to convey different meanings.  This is
how language works, Robert, and it's why making someone an offender for a
word is dangerous.


<...>

   On the contrary, Robert, it is not a red herring at all to show that those
who rely wholly on the Bible cannot seem to agree on what it says.  You say
that one must simply ""look at the Bible"" to see what it teaches, but centuries
of people doing just that have sho0wn that no one is really sure what it says.
Are we to believe that you are the only one who really understands the
scriptures?


  Let me clarify this one more time.  You did not refer to the Mormon belief
that Jesus needed to be saved, but rather to McConkie's belief in same.  We
keep trying to point out to you that Bruce McConkie is not the source of
Mormon doctrine, and you keep ignoring it. (see below)


  On the contrary, Robert, if you are quoting McConkie's words as Mormon
canon then the question of whether they are canon or not is of *great*
importance.  The fact is that they are not.  Whether or not they indicate
general Mormon belief would only be ascertainable by interviewing a large
number of Mormons.",religion

Are most players who come up young always good when they're young, or

Damn.  I was afraid you would say that!


Well, perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it
would be Lopez in there.  But they do have others worth playing, at
least in *their* opinion.  And I happen to agree.


I can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But
Alomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above.
That is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long
as they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a
consensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to
give him that dreaded ""seasoning"".


Sorry.  New.  Don't know Nichols' Law.  Don't believe in catchers'
era.  But I am interested in pitchers' eras with different catchers.
Any info on that?


In other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind 
a different decision than we would make must be financial.  I presume
we feel this way about other franchises than Atlanta, no?


Well if it does make organizational sense, one can hardly fault them
for their decisions.  I mean, please don't tell me how to run my
business.  Especially when I'm being successful.


I'm sure you could be right.  You could also be smoking some illegal
substance.

(Hey.  That's a joke.  Don't get offended.  Please.)

Well, I can't cite anyone's ethical rectitude because I don't know
what it means.  :)

But again, if it makes organizational sense, then so be it.  Baseball
is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping
Lopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.

I happen to believe that it's a baseball decision.  While you from
your armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot of
evidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among
large guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I
think it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly
more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have
released one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It
may also be logical.  I don't know what ethics have to do with it.
Seems like pretty good common sense to me.

"-> > This mention of a well regulated militia is what confuses me.  According
-> > to the Federalist Paper's, a well regulated militia has a well defined 
-> > structure and follows nationally uniform regulations.
-> 
-> Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!

Perhaps you should, reread Federal 29 which deals exclusively with the
""well regulated malitia.""  Here is what is says about its character:

	 To oblige the great body of the yeomanry, and of the other classes
	 of the citizens, to be under arms for the purpose of going through
	 military exercises and evolutions, as often as might be necessary to
	 acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the
	 character of a well-regulated militia, 

It also talks about the ""well regulated militia"" having a nationally
uniform in structure and disipline.  

I will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states:

    	Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with
	respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed
	and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it
	will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of
	a year.

But, do you knew how much organization is required to training a large
group of poeple twice a year.  Just to try to get the same people
every year, provide a basic training to new people so they can
be integrated into the force, and find a suitable location, it 
requires a continually standing committee of organizers.  

Since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and
disipline, and meet once or twice a year to train, how can you claim
a ""well regulated militia"" is not well organized.  But I will concide 
a ""well organized militia"" is not necessarily a ""well regulated militia."" 

Several people have stated that the ""well organized militia"" is
what is defined under 10 USC 311, which states

	The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied 
	males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in 
	section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, 
	or who have made a declaration of intention to become, 
	citizens of the United States and of female citizents of 
	the United States who are commissioned officers of the 
	National Guard.

This deos define the militia, but were is the adjective ""well regulated.""
10 USC 311 does not define a ""well regualed militia"" in any way, shape, 
or form.  It only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia
The Federalist Papers CLEARLY define the ""well regualed militia"" as a
proper SUBSET of the militia.  In the same paragraph quoted above, it
talk above ""disciplining all the militia of the United States"" so they
fit the ""character of a well-regulated militia.""  This is what the
paragraph states about the associated costs:

	It would form an annual deduction from the productive labor 
	of the country, to an amount which, calculating upon the 
	present numbers of the people, would not fall far short 
	of the whole expense of the civil  establishments of all 
	the States. To attempt a thing which would abridge the 
	mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent,
	would be unwise: and the experiment, if made, could not 
	succeed, because it would not long be endured.


Another quote provide by Charles Scripter is:
James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the ""General Welfare"" clause): 
	""Nothing is more natural nor common than first
	to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a
	recital of particulars.""

So the phrase ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall 
not be infringed"" must either qualify or explain the phrase ""a well 
regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state.""  
The definition of ""explain"" as stated in ""The American Hertitage
Dictionary of the Enlish Language"" The New College Edition, 1982 is:
	1) To make plain or comprehensible; remove obscruity from;
	   elucidate: ""It was the economists who undertook to explain 
	   this puzzle""
	2) To define; explicate; expound: He explained his plan.
	3) To offer reasons for or a cause of; an answer for' justify:
	   explain an error
The second phrase clearly does not ""explain"" the first, therefore
the second phrase must ""qualify"" the first.  The definition given
for ""qualify"" is:
	1) To describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities
	   of; characterize.
	2) To make competent or suitable for office, position, or 
	   task.
	3) To give legal power to; make legally capable.
	4) To modify, limit, or restrict, as giving exceptions.
	5) To make less harsh or severe; moderate
	6) Grammar: To modify the meaning of (a word or phrase)
Since ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be
infringed"" does not describe, modify or make less harsh anything and
it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task.
By process of elimination it must fall into definition #3.  And since
#3 deals with legal power, the same thing the Constitution does, it
must be the correct definition in this case.  Therefore, ""the right 
of the people to keep and bear Arms"" gives legal power to the ""well 
regualated militia"" and this legal power ""shall not be infringed"".  

I thank you very much Mr Scripter, you have provided me with more 
evidence that the Second Amendment only concerns itseft with the 
people's right to form well regulate militia, and says very little 
about the right of an untrained person to ""keep and bear"" a .50 caliber
machine gun.  And since I, totally untrained in the use of any firearm
(something I personly have meant to correct by going to a NRA gun
safety course and joining a gun club), cannot legally buy such a machine
gun, I conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with
me.

-> So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy
-> our Liberties and Rights.

I mean ""to destory our Liberties and Rights.""  Is that why a participate
in the discussion of exactly what ""our Libertues and Rights"" are?  I 
force my version of ""our Liberties and Rights"" by begining statements
of what ""our Liberties and Rights"" with ""All that the Second Amendment 
clearly states to me.""   Using expressions, such as ""states to me,"" 
clearly mean I intend to force my views on others?  I don't think so.

So in effort not to force my views and not ""to destory our Liberties and
Rights,""  I state that nothing I have written, or will write, in

SPACE SHUTTLE ANSWERS, LAUNCH SCHEDULES, TV COVERAGE

    SHUTTLE LAUNCHINGS AND LANDINGS; SCHEDULES AND HOW TO SEE THEM

    Shuttle operations are discussed in the Usenet group sci.space.shuttle,
    and Ken Hollis (gandalf@pro-electric.cts.com) posts a compressed version
    of the shuttle manifest (launch dates and other information)
    periodically there. The manifest is also available from the Ames SPACE
    archive in SPACE/FAQ/manifest. The portion of his manifest formerly
    included in this FAQ has been removed; please refer to his posting or
    the archived copy. For the most up to date information on upcoming
    missions, call (407) 867-INFO (867-4636) at Kennedy Space Center.

    Official NASA shuttle status reports are posted to sci.space.news
    frequently.


    WHY DOES THE SHUTTLE ROLL JUST AFTER LIFTOFF?

    The following answer and translation are provided by Ken Jenks
    (kjenks@gothamcity.jsc.nasa.gov).

    The ""Ascent Guidance and Flight Control Training Manual,"" ASC G&C 2102,

	""During the vertical rise phase, the launch pad attitude is
	commanded until an I-loaded V(rel) sufficient to assure launch tower
	clearance is achieved. Then, the tilt maneuver (roll program)
	orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a
	negative q-alpha, which in turn alleviates structural loading. Other
	advantages with this attitude are performance gain, decreased abort
	maneuver complexity, improved S-band look angles, and crew view of
	the horizon. The tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining
	downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff (MECO) target
	in second stage.""

    This really is a good answer, but it's couched in NASA jargon. I'll try
    to interpret.

    1)	We wait until the Shuttle clears the tower before rolling.

    2)	Then, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack
	between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere (the
	""relative wind"") and the chord of the wings (the imaginary line
	between the leading edge and the trailing edge) is a slightly
	negative angle (""a negative q-alpha"").	This causes a little bit of
	""downward"" force (toward the belly of the Orbiter, or the +Z
	direction) and this force ""alleviates structural loading.""
	We have to be careful about those wings -- they're about the
	most ""delicate"" part of the vehicle.

    3)	The new attitude (after the roll) also allows us to carry more
	mass to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass, or
	to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be
	the case if we didn't roll (""performance gain"").

    4)	The new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated
	flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort
	maneuvers, the Return To Launch Site (""decreased abort maneuver
	complexity"").

    5)	The new attitude improves the ability for ground-based radio
	antennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the S-band radio
	antennae on the Orbiter (""improved S-band look angles"").

    6)	The new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon, which is a
	helpful (but not mandatory) part of piloting any flying machine.

    7)	The new attitude orients the Shuttle so that the body is
	more nearly parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east
	(usually).  This allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity
	in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:
	velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction.
	The Shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its
	velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.

    This all begs the question, ""Why isn't the launch pad oriented to give
    this nice attitude to begin with?  Why does the Shuttle need to roll to
    achieve that attitude?""  The answer is that the pads were leftovers
    from the Apollo days.  The Shuttle straddles two flame trenches -- one
    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main
    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effects of this on any daytime
    launch.  The SRM exhaust is dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust is
    fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the ""top""
    [Orbiter side] and the ""bottom"" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The
    access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented
    basically the same way they were for the Saturn V's.  (A side note: the
    Saturn V's also had a roll program.  Don't ask me why -- I'm a Shuttle
    guy.)

    I checked with a buddy in Ascent Dynamics.	He added that the ""roll
    maneuver"" is really a maneuver in all three axes: roll, pitch and yaw.
    The roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons
    stated.  The pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping
    the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw
    component is used to determine the orbital inclination.  The total
    maneuver is really expressed as a ""quaternion,"" a grad-level-math
    concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four-element
    array.


    HOW TO RECEIVE THE NASA TV CHANNEL, NASA SELECT

    NASA SELECT is broadcast by satellite. If you have access to a satellite
    dish, you can find SELECT on Satcom F2R, Transponder 13, C-Band, 72
    degrees West Longitude, Audio 6.8, Frequency 3960 MHz. F2R is stationed
    over the Atlantic, and is increasingly difficult to receive from
    California and points west. During events of special interest (e.g.
    shuttle missions), SELECT is sometimes broadcast on a second satellite
    for these viewers.

    If you can't get a satellite feed, some cable operators carry SELECT.
    It's worth asking if yours doesn't.

    The SELECT schedule is found in the NASA Headline News which is
    frequently posted to sci.space.news. Generally it carries press
    conferences, briefings by NASA officials, and live coverage of shuttle
    missions and planetary encounters. SELECT has recently begun carrying
    much more secondary material (associated with SPACELINK) when missions
    are not being covered.

    W5RRR transmits mission audio on 146.64, a special event station on the
    other frequencies supplying Keplerian Elements and mission information.

    W1AW also transmits on 147.555, 18.160. No mission audio but they
    transmit voice bulletins at 0245 and 0545 UTC.

    Frequencies in the 10-20m bands require USB and frequencies in the 40
    and 80m bands LSB. Use FM for the VHF frequencies.

"First, I would like to say how much I appreciate having so literate and
erudite an individual as Mr. Rutledge with whom to discuss this topic.
Frankly, most anti-RKBA posters refuse even to approach the topic of
the original understanding of the Bill of Rights as detailed in the
writings of the era. This  is most refreshing.

Second, I must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days.
My brigade's quarterly drill was this weekend and I needed to attend
to several matters pertaining to the State Militia.

Some people seem to feel that the concept of the Militia is an anachro-
nism that is out of place in the 20th century. I'm not sure the Swiss
would agree and I think perhaps a discussion of how the Militia, both
organized and unorganized, fits into the defense plans of my State,
Mississippi. Please do not assume that this describes something peculiar
to one southern state. For instance, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts
has a well organized Militia which, members report, maintains stocks
of both riot guns and machine guns. The laws of other States will vary
but are probably similar.

Title 35  of Mississippi Code defines our Militia as ""all able-bodied
citizens of the state between the ages of seventeen (17) and sixty-
two (62) years..."". The Militia is divided into 3 classes: The National
Guard, the Mississippi State Guard and the unorganized Militia.  The
National Guard is a strange sort of fish from a Constitutional perspective.
It tries to be both State Militia and Federal Reserve. The discussion
of this ""para-constitutional"" arrangement is quite interesting in itself
but somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion. Suffice it that, at this
date, the National Guard has ceased to have any Constitutional standing
as anything but a Federal reserve force.

Mississippi, and most other States, maintains a purely State organized
Militia. In Mississippi this is called The State Guard. In other 
States it may be called something else. The State Guard exists as
a cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and
senior NCOs who serve as volunteers without compensation. We drill
on a monthly basis at the company and battalion level, brigade once
a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization. Our
State-authorized cadre strength is 694. This is a skeleton of an
organization without any flesh. The muscle and sinew when needed will
come from the unorganized Militia.

In time of invasion, insurrection or calamity the Governor can order
the activation of the State Guard. When this takes place a call will
first be made  for volunteers to fill the organization out to either
its contingency strength of 2194 or full strength of 4910. In the
event that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer, the law
provides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the
unorganized Militia. The size of the State Guard is not specified by
law, but rather by executive order. At one time, the organized Militia
of Mississippi consisted of 68 regiments. Needless to say, the State
does not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such
a force. The historical precedent for arming such a force is by use
of mostly the private arms of the Militiamen. 

It is my hope that demonstrates that State Militias are far from being
the long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim.


Regarding Hamilton: If you take Hamilton's opinion as being the sole
representative of the opinions of the Founding Fathers, you will have
chosen a highly skewed sample set. Hamilton was on the extreme Federalist
end of the political spectrum. Others, such as Coxe and Henry, can
be chosen to represent the other end. Many contemporaries felt that
the idea of having a standing Army of any sort or even a select Militia
or ""train bands"" were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern-
ment they were striving to perfect. The compromise reached was to
provide for a small Army, which had to be refinanced every two years,
and iron-clad protection for the Militia, which was to remain ever,
""terrible and irresistible"".

These protections included: State control, not Federal; limitation
of Federal utilization of the Militia (i.e. execute Laws, suppress
Insurrections and repel Invasions), and the Right to Keep and Bear
Arms to prevent what the British had tried to do at Lexington.
These limitations eventually proved so onerous to the Federal Govern-
ment that they were skirted by the creation of the National Guard.

The National Guard was created for one very simple reason: the 
Constitutional Militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting
wars of imperial expansion. (e.g. Spanish-American War). The
Constitution provided that the Militia could only be employed by
the Federal government in very limited purposes. As far back as the
War of 1812, Militia units had refused to leave United States
territory to attack the enemy. Further, there was no Constitutional
authorization for any conscription of anyone into the Federal
Military and Militiamen were particularly protected. In all wars until
WW-I every American who left the country under arms was a volunteer.
When the National Guard acts of 1903-1916 required that each new
member also enlist as a reservest in the Army, existing soldiers were
""grandfathered"". At least one of these ""grandfathered"" individuals
refused to go to France in 1918 and his refusal was upheld by the
Federal Courts.

Mr. Rutledge has stated that the Second Amendment applies only to
members of a ""well organized"" militia. However, the pre-Constitutional
history of the American Militia shows relatively few periods when
The Militia came close to meeting either Messrs. Rutledge or Hamilton's
definition of ""well organized"". In the period of peace between the
French & Indian War and The Revolution many companies simply stopped
drilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to The Revolution.
Perhaps Mr. Rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors
who answered the Lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because
their units didn't drill for a few years in the 1760s. I would not
be so bold.

Again, I wish to repeat. The National Guard, for all its merits, is
not the Militia described by the Constitution  nor by Mr. Hamilton
nor by Mr. Henry nor by Mr. Coxe. The fact that the Federal Government
and many States are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing
of their Constitutional Militias  diminishes neither their
responsibilities nor the rights of the Militia as detailed in the
Constitution.
 
Misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the Militia is but one
error that has crept into modern readings of the Constitution. The
Constitution prohibits States from keeping ""Troops or Ships of War
in time of Peace"". I have heard some insist this prevents States from
maintaining a Militia, but this comes about because people today do not
understand the meanings of the words in their 18th century usage.
Today we call any large vessel a ""ship"" but in the 18th century the word
described a particular kind of vessel.  A ""ship"" is a large vessel with
three or more masts each carrying square rigged sails. A ""brig"" has two
masts. In the contemporary usage the States were prohibited only from keeping
the largest warships of the day, those capable of global operations. Today's
equivalent might be a prohibition on the States' keeping nuclear missiles.
""Troops"" at this time meant a full-time professional military organization.
Any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out. 

In at least one respect, I am in agreement with Mr. Rutledge; being
personally involved in the maintenance and advancement of The Militia

"I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've 
transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means
infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is 
granted to copy this without restriction.

Michael Sternberg, Cheif of Operations of RIMSAT, was invited to speak at an
informal lunch held by ACDIS here on the campus of the University of Illinois.
ACDIS is an organization on campus that deals with Arms Control, Disarmament and
International Security.  RIMSAT was considered an appropriate topic because the
company is using Russian launchers and satellites.  I think it also helped that
his daughter is a grad student in the International Relations program.

The concept behind RIMSAT apparently began when Matt Neilson (?) went to Tonga
to visit a friend.  While he was there, he somehow ended up visiting the king,
who happened to be a big TV fan.  Matt bought the King a satellite dish, which 
the king thought was really nifty.  Since Tonga has a GNP of about $70 million,
His Majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this.  Matt thought
there probably was, so at his suggestion, Tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous
satellite slots.  While this isn't entirely off the wall, it was very unusual,
seeing as Tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 is a lot of
slots.

The whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl
Hilliard (who is apparently a respected space lawyer) wrote several opinions
supporting Tonga's case.  Eventually Tonga ended up with 7 slots, ranging from 
70 E to 170 E (slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside).
According to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the
world because they are excellently placed for communications between Hawaii and 
the Pacific Rim. 

RIMSAT was formed to use these slots. It was officially formed in Nevis as a tax
haven.  They tried for a few years to raise funds in the west, however, to
fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have
cost approximately $2 billion.  It's not easy to raise that kind of money.
Eventually, they hit upon the idea of using Russian hardware.  They began 
negotiating with Glavkosmos for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describes operating in 
Moscow in such harsh terms that I don't think I'll visit there for a long time.
Besides a significant lack of creature comforts, he was not happy with the way
that people operate.  For example ""everybody can sell you everything.""  
Everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the
only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.

Eventually, RIMSAT arranged a deal with Glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost
of $150 million.  However, Glavkosmos lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg
says that this is because they were basically a bunch of KGB operatives who 
went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures.  Since Glavkosmos was
out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities.  He
again described life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms.  Eventually,
he worked out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who heads the 
Russian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insisted on a few concessions
before signing and according to Sternberg he arranged these new rules to 
allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as RIMSAT.

The next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware, NPO Applied 
Mechanics -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  This organization is located in 
Siberia (can't figure out how to spell the town, I need an atlas) and has built
about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg commented that
siberians are very different from Musovites.  They are hard workers, honest
people who team up to get things done, very much like midwesterners.  At this
point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on
both siberians and midwesterners :-)

Sternberg had lots of good things to say about NPO PM.  His company is 
apparently lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partners.It apparently costs the Russians about $4 million to build a satellite that
would sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them 
specifications, they'll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellites
that RIMSAT will be using, costs run about $378,000 per transponder year.  This
compares to $810,000 t/y in the U.S.  They can sell their time for about $1.1
million compared to $2.6 million in the U.S.  RIMSAT will launch their 
satellites on Protons.  To get the best prices, they bought in bulk.  They 
have the rights to twelve launches, so if any of you need a lift I can give
you their address.  The first launch is scheduled for October and they are
getting one used satellite from the Russians, which is being moved into place
now.

Tidbits:

*  Sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs, not big
business because big business is just like what they have over there, except
that ""we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.""

*  Russian launches are self insured.  The promise to replace a failed launch
within 9 months.

*  Major investors in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which is a huge retirement
fund organization, Cellsat, which is a big telecom business in southeast Asia,
and a fund operated by some of the big names in U.S aerospace which he says is
sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off.

*  He downplayed the instabilites in the ex-USSR saying that we are worried
partly because we aren't used to seeing Russia as anything but an unvarying
monolith.  Italy gets a new government ""every two weeks"" but we don't worry 
because we're used to it.  He predicted that once we get used to seeing what
really goes on in Russia we won't worry about their stability as much.

*  Part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering
money.  The central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments, putting
25% in their coffers and replacing the rest with the ""equivalent"" value in 
rubles.  To get around this, RIMSAT pays their hard currency into an Austrian
bank account.  NPO PM then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that
the only the contractors get swindled by the government.

*  One of the big problems RIMSAT has had is stonewalling by the western 
satellite industry.  However, Intelsat recently bought three of the same type
of satellites, which was rather reassuring.

*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive
technology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellites have
a lifetime of about 5 years, while the more modern Express satellites compare
well with western technology and last about 8 years.  While this is much 
shorter than 15 years for western satellites, Sternberg downplayed the 
difference.  At these prices they can afford to launch new ones.  In addition,
shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer
technology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date
hardware.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                              April 15, 1993
#1506

     Scientists at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory report the
successful flight of a balloon carrying instruments designed to
measure and study chemicals in the Earth's ozone layer.

     The April 3 flight from California's Barstow/Daggett Airport
reached an altitude of 37 kilometers (121,000 feet) and took
measurements as part of a program established to correlate data
with the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite (UARS).  

     The data from the balloon flight will also be compared to
readings from the Atmospheric Trace Molecular Spectroscopy
(ATMOS) experiment which is currently flying onboard the shuttle
Discovery.

     ""We launch these balloons several times a year as part of an
ongoing ozone research program.  In fact, JPL is actively
involved in the study of ozone and the atmosphere in three
important ways,"" said Dr. Jim Margitan, principal investigator on
the balloon research campaign.  

     ""There are two JPL instruments on the UARS satellite,"" he
continued.  ""The ATMOS experiment is conducted by JPL scientists,
and the JPL balloon research provides collaborative ground truth
for those activities, as well as data that is useful in its own
right.""

     The measurements taken by the balloon payload will add more
pieces to the complex puzzle of the atmosphere, specifically the
mid-latitude stratosphere during winter and spring. 
Understanding the chemistry occurring in this region helps
scientists construct more accurate computer models which are
instrumental in predicting future ozone conditions.

     The scientific balloon payload consisted of three JPL
instruments:  an ultraviolet ozone photometer which measures
ozone as the balloon ascends and descends through the atmosphere;
a submillimeterwave limb sounder which looks at microwave
radiation emitted by molecules in the atmosphere; and a Fourier
transform infrared interferometer which monitors how the
atmosphere absorbs sunlight. 

     Launch occurred at about noontime, and following a three-
hour ascent, the balloon floated eastward at approximately 130
kilometers per hour (70 knots).  Data was radioed to ground
stations and recorded onboard.  The flight ended at 10 p.m.
Pacific time in eastern New Mexico when the payload was commanded
to separate from the balloon.

     ""We needed to fly through sunset to make the infrared
measurements,"" Margitan explained, ""and we also needed to fly in
darkness to watch how quickly some of the molecules disappear.""

     It will be several weeks before scientists will have the
completed results of their experiments.  They will then forward
their data to the UARS central data facility at the Goddard Space
Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland for use by the UARS
scientists.    

     The balloon was launched by the National Scientific Balloon
Facility, normally based in Palestine, Tex., operating under a
contract from NASA's Wallops Flight Facility.  The balloon was
launched in California because of the west-to-east wind direction
and the desire to keep the operation in the southwest.

     The balloons are made of 20-micron (0.8 mil, or less than
one-thousandth of an inch) thick plastic, and are 790,000 cubic
meters (28 million cubic feet) in volume when fully inflated with
helium (120 meters (400 feet) in diameter).  The balloons weigh
between 1,300 and 1,800 kilograms (3,000 and 4,000 pounds).  The
scientific payload weighs about 1,300 kilograms (3,000) pounds
and is 1.8 meters (six feet) square by 4.6 meters (15 feet) high.

     The JPL balloon research is sponsored by NASA's Upper
Atmosphere Research Program and the UARS Correlative Measurements
Program.                        ",space

"Joint Press release ESA/UN No 18-93
Paris, 19 April 1993

UN/ESA joint training course on satellite applications
to be held in Italy, 19-30 April

The United Nations and the European Space Agency (ESA)
are jointly organising a training course on the applications of
satellite data gathered by the European Remote Sensing
Satellite (ERS-1), to be held in Frascati, Italy, from 19 to 30
April. The training course will discuss the applications of
satellite data concerning natural resources, renewable energy
and the environment.

The training course, organised for the benefit of francophone
African experts, will be hosted by ESRIN, the European Space
Agency's establishment in Frascati, which is responsible for
coordination with the users of data from ESA's remote sensing
satellite. Twenty-four experts in the field of remote sensing,
selected from 19 francophone countries from northern, western
and central Africa, and three regional African centres, will
attend the two-week session. The course will focus on remote
sensing techniques and data applications, particularly ERS-1
data.

The ERS-1 satellite, developed by ESA and launched in 1991
with the European Ariane launcher, carries an advanced radar
instrument and is the first in a series of radar remote sensing
missions that will ensure availability of data beyond the year
2000. The aim of the training course is to increase the
potential of experts using the practical applications of radar
remote sensing systems to natural resources, renewable energy
and the environment, with particular emphasis on applications
to geology and mineral prospecting, oceanography and near-
coastal areas, agriculture, forestry and meteorology.

The education and practical training programme was
developed jointly by the United Nations and ESA. The
facilities and the technical support, as well as lecturers and
information documents for the training course, will be
provided by the Agency. Lecturers at the training course will
include high-level experts from other European and African
organisations active in remote sensing applications. Funds for
the training course are being provided by the United Nations

  Minor quibble:  The assualt (and it was one) began near dawn.  The fire did
not break out for several hours.  I find it highly unlikely that the BD would
be cooking lunch while armored vehicles punch holes in their house and are
pumping in tear gas.  The lantern story makes more sense, except the fire 
seemed to spread too quickly, even given the nature of the buildings and the
very high winds.  And it was daylight, but I guess in the innner recesses it
could be dark--shutters probably closed as well.

  Which puts us back to the FBI did it, or the BD did it, or some other screw-
up occured, which is quite possible.

  The problem with the FBI as a monolithic entity doing it is that it requires
*everybody* involved to keep their mouths shut.  While they tended to behave 
like total idiots, that does not make them homocidal maniacs, either.  And if
it was one nutcase agent, then it serves no purpose to blame the whole agency.

  I can believe that a real nut-case like a Koresh would start such a fire,
but I'm far from convinced he actually did so.

  Then again, I rarely go off making blanket condemnations and pronouncments

Let us explore this interesting paragraph point by point, sentence by
sentence.


1) We are talking about origins, not merely science.

Origins of what?  Are we speaking of the origins of life, the human
species, the universe, physical law, biological diversity or what?

2) Science cannot explain origins.

This is a false statement unless it is carefully qualified.  It depends
on what origins we are talking about.

3) For a person to exclude anything but science from the issue of origins
is to say that there is no higher truth than science.

Again, this is a false statement.  To begin with, the notion of ""higher
truth"" is distinctly dubious.  Many people believe that there are ways
to ascertain truth that are not in the repetoire of science; they even
believe that there are ways that are more reliable and certain.  Many
believe that there are truths that cannot be expressed using the language
of science.  Let it be so.  These truths are neither ""higher"" or 
""lower""; they are simply true.

More to the point, restricting one's discussion of origins to science
does not reject other sources of knowledge; it simply restricts the
scope of discussion.

4) This is a false premise.

If this is intended as asserting that the previous sentence was false
then (4) is actually true.  However the context identifies it as another
false [or at least theologically unsound] statement.

5) By the way, I enjoy science.

On the evidence Mr. Rawlins lacks sufficient understanding of science
to enjoy science in any meaningful sense.  One might just as well say
that one enjoys literature written in a language that one cannot read.
However one cannot mark this sentence as false -- to follow the analogy,
perhaps he likes the pretty shapes of the letters.

6) It is truly a wonder observing God's creation.

Let us not quibble; count this one as true.

7) Macroevolution is a mixture of 15 percent science and 85 percent
religion [guaranteed within three percent error :) ]

Still another false statement.  However one can make it come out true
with the following contextual modification:

""Macroevolution, as misunderstood by Rawline, is a mixture of 15 percent
of what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as science, and 85 percent of
what Rawlins erroneously thinks of as religion.""

-----

It is distinctly noticeable that Mr. Rawlins fails miserably to touch
on truth except when he reports personally on what he feels.  [I do
him the justice of assuming that he is not misinforming us as to his
personal reactions.]  One can account for this by the hypothesis that
he has an idiosyncratic and personal concept of truth.",religion

There were many injustices in the middle ages.  And this is truely sad.
I would hate to see a day when churches put people to death or torchured
them for practicing homosexuality, or any other crime.  The church is not

Christians to practice homosexual immorality.  Do you think that we should
also teach Christians to practice divination and channelling because
the witches in the middle ages were persecuted.



And you accuse me of judging?  When did you look into my heart and see

to practice homosexual immorality, and you pretend to have divine knowledge
to look into my heart.  I can't say that I love homosexuals as I should-
I can't say that I love my neighbor as I should either.  I don't know
very many homosexuals as it is.  

But Jesus loves homosexuals, just as He loves everyone else.  If His love
were conditional, I not know Him at all.  Yes.  We should show love to 
homosexuals, but it is not love to encourage brothers in the church to 
stumble and continue in their sin.  That is a very damaging and dangerous

to implement legislation to make child molesting easier because of
the tearing down of societies morality due to people accepting homosexuality
as normal, and that this is what you are embracing.  I do believe
that homosexual sex is immoral, that does not mean I endorse using violence
against them.  There is a problem of hatred in the church.  But there
is also the problem of what has been called ""unsanctified mercy.""
Many in the conservative churches have seen the moral breakdown in 
this country and the storm on the horizon, and have gotten militant in 
the flesh.  This is truely sad.  Yet others in other churches have 
embraced immorality in society, and have pointed to the carnality in the
conservative churches to justify their actions.  


Certainly we should not use a bullwhip to drive people from Jesus.
But we shouldn't water down the gospel to draw people in.  Jesus didn't
go out of His way to show only what might be considered positive aspects
to draw people in.  He told one man to sell all He had.  He told
another not to say good bye to His family.  His words were hard at times.
We should present people with the cost of the tower before we allow them
to begin construction.  many people have already been innoculated to the
gospel.

So, like, what do you do during those six months to be ""active?""
My town has a similar requirement, and it's rather stupid.  Before
you can buy a handgun, you have to be an active member of a gun club.
Well, how active can you be without a gun, chief?

Most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental
disorders would be a very good thing -- IF it couldn't be abused by the
government.  But every time this is proposed, there is always some
trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase EVEN IF you
are perfectly qualified to own a gun.  And we oppose this.


Since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the US 
is around 50 times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun
owners, I'd think twice before using this analogy.

Besides, the problem is criminal use of guns, not accidents.  (There
are about 500,000 criminal uses of guns in the US every year -- but
only 1,400 accidents.)  I don't think it's necessary to spend a lot
of energy making sure a criminal CAN shoot a gun before he gets one.

Just like the check, most gun owners feel positively about requiring
safety courses -- IF they couldn't be abused by the government.  But 
they already have!  One state doesn't hold the courses, another doesn't 
fund them, a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence 
to those with political connections.  Is this fair?


And how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets?
How many are borrowed, stolen, smuggled, bought on the black market?


Some states allow ONLY open carry.  Some allow ONLY concealed carry.
Some allow both.  Some allow both, but require licenses for concealed 
carry.  All you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage
over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good,
then state legislators SOMEPLACE are doing exactly the wrong thing.
Which means that they really don't have any objective reasons for 
these laws other than their preferences -- a bad way to govern.


(""Hot-livered.""  I LOVE that expression.  Here, we say ""hot-headed."")


Typically, the only criminals who can affect the rights of ALL the other
people are criminals in government offices.  The rest of our criminals
affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time, and they do this
during the commission of a crime.  POSSESSION of a gun by someone hurts
NO ONE else.  It is when they do something violent with that gun that
the crime occurs.  Of course, it is a crime for a felon or ex-felon to
possess a gun, but we don't feel it is right to treat common citizens
who have lived good lives as if they were just ""pre-felons"" waiting to
commit crimes.


I don't understand this sentence.


Life isn't fair.  I shouldn't need a fire extinguisher either, or
flood and theft insurance, or to lock the doors of my house and car.
But pining for a better world won't do anything to address what I have
to do to live in this one.


None of ours, I'm sure.


Frankly, I'm not sure I know what good a driver's license does anyone,
either.  The people who drive safely never use it, and the people who 
drive drunk, drive without it!

However, a car is a good tool, but not one that protects my right to life.
I rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely.


The question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally.  It's
whether or not you think that ALL people should be forced to do as you do.
I don't have any problem with someone who says they would never own a gun.
I do have a problem with someone who says I should be prevented from owning
one, too.

Wait a minute. S&K did NOT compare trends.  If they did, they would
have seen that the advent of Canada's gun law had no effect on
homicides, total or handgun.  Without a pre- vs. post comparison, one

correlation, and correlation DOES NOT prove causality.



Hold it again. You dismiss a point about demographics, then you ask
about socio-economic demographics? Very slick.

Once again, correlation does not prove causality.  Looking at pre-vs.
post data, the Canadian gun law had no effect.


Sir, if you were a Canadian, and owned a gun before the restrictive
gun laws were passed, and decided to hide it rather than turn it in,
would you answer truthfully a question about gun ownership from
someone who calls, writes, or asks you on the street?  That is one
problem with surveys.  Nobody will answer an incriminating question.
Another is that people will often tell you what they THINK you want to
here.


Does that mean no Vancouver citizens have handguns? I think not. You
are discounting guns purchased beforehand, and guns purchased for

I assume p is the semi-major axis and e the eccentricity.  The peri-
helion and aphelion are then given by p(1-e) and p(1+e), i.e., about
2.90 and 3.95 AU respectively.  For Jupiter, they are 4.95 and 5.45 AU.
If 1977 was after the temporary capture, this means that the comet
ended up in an orbit that comes no closer than 1 AU to Jupiter's --
which I take to be a rough indication of how far from Jupiter it could
get under Jupiter's influence.


Where 1 Jupiter radius = 71,000 km = 44,000 mi = 0.0005 AU.  So the
1970 figure seems unlikely to actually be anything but a perijove.
Is that the case for the 1973 figure as well?

Ah, there's the rub.  And a catch-22 to boot.  For the purposes of a

demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system.  Course, if a

low cost payload delivery systems.  The accounting methods would probably
be the hardest to work out.  For example, would you allow Rockwell to
'loan' you the engines?  And so forth...


This depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line.  In other

Robinson 17.72  152  350  35  15  .971

Even if Robinson's extra 3 putouts, 2 assists, and 5 DPs are taken to mean
he was responsible for 10 more outs in the field, that doesn't make up
for the extra 28 outs he made at the plate, not to mention the fewer
total bases.  The difference of .104 in OPS should be decreased by about
.025 to account for Wrigley, but a .079 difference is still considerable.

Usual disclaimers about T&P's FR apply, but they really shouldn't be
way off the mark in this comparison.  At least it's better than fielding
percentage: Carney Lansford has a .966 , 10th best all-time, but -225 FR,
dead last of all time.  Also, since this total rating compares players
to league average instead of replacement level, Robinson should be
awarded an extra 6.5 or so for playing 653 more games.  He had a great
career, but I would prefer Santo's plus 4 years of a replacement level 3Bman.

But I would knock Traynor off the list and replace him by Stan Hack.
That's a similar story, Hack's far better hitting outweighs Traynor's
superior fielding.  Graig Nettles and Buddy Bell would also be better
choices (IMHO of course, though some recent net discussion supports
this point of view.)

  ""Another problem is what are called 'wraps' (or sometimes

   Freedom or Shuttle is performed at a NASA center, the
   center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts
   to a slush fund. This money is used to fund work the
   center manager wants to fund. This sum is estimated to
   be over a third of the funds allocated. Think about
   that: Of the $30 billion cost of Freedom, fully $10
   billion won't be spent on anything having anything
   to do with Space Stations! Now, maybe that $10 billion
   was wisely spent (and maybe it wasn't), but the work done
   with it should stand on its own merits, not distorting
   the cost of other projects. Congress has no idea of the
   existense of these wraps; Congress has never heard the
   term 'center tax'. They look at the Station they are
   getting and the price they are paying and note that
   it doesn't add up. They wonder this blissfully unaware
   that a third of the money is going for something else.""

My dear friends, your mixing fact and fiction here. A couple
of weeks ago, when I first read this in your posting, I
talked with one of the cost experts here in Space Station
at Headquarters [if you wondering why I didn't post a
response immediately, I do have a real job I'm supposed
to be doing here at Headquarters, & digging up old 20 kHz
data & looking into Sherzer/Kyger claims rates pretty low
on the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend
in Kansas City, at the National Science Teachers 
Association conference, extolling the virtues of SSF
to 15,000 science teachers.]

First off, yes, the concept of 'center tax', or 'wrap' does
exist. If I recall the numbers correctly, the total 'tax'
for the SSF program for this fiscal year is around $40 Million.
This was computed by adding up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4
center 'taxes'. With the SSF budget for this fiscal year at
$2.2 Billion, my calculater says the tax percentage is
04/2.2 = 1.8%

Over the life of the SSF program, using your figure of $30
billion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate comes to
$540 million. This is alot less than $10 billion, but I
will concede it's still an appreciable amount of pocket
change.

I should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could
be close to the actual rate. The tax is only charged on funds
that are spent at the center (kind of like McDonalds at some
states, where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat
the food at the restaurant, but you don't if you get it
take-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the funds
we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*
subject to the center tax (I don't have the numbers in
front of me, but I'd guess at least 95% of the WP-4 funds
go to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax
rate of 1/3, but it's only applied to funds spent at the
center, and not to the prime contracts.

This leads to the obvious question ""What is the government
doing with SSF funds that don't go to the prime contractors?
(i.e. ok, WP-4 gets a slice of the $30 billion pie. A
big portion of this slice goes to Rocketdyne. What happens
to the balance of the funds, which aren't eaten
up by the center tax?)""

At WP-4, we call these funds we spend in-house supporting
development funds (as they are supporting the development
work done by Rocketdyne). We have used these funds to
setup our own testbed, to checkout the electrical
power system architecture. Our testbed has a real life
solar array field (left over from solar cell research
research a few years back), with lead-acid car batteries
(to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batteries on SSF), DC
switchgear, DC-DC converter units, and simulated
loads. Data from the testbed was used in a recent
change evaluation involving concerns about the stability
of the power system.

We have also used the supporting development money to
purchase Nickel Hydrogen batteries, which are on life
testing at both Lewis and the Crane Naval facility in
Indiana. As a side point, 6 of the battery cells on
test recently hit the four year life test milestone.
38 cells have completed 18,552 to 23,405 cycles (the
on-orbit batteries go through 5,840 cycles per year).

As a final example, my 'home' division at Lewis used
the supporting development funds to purchase personal
computers and work stations, for performing system
analyses (like modeling of the performance of the
electrical power system, availability calculations
using a Monte-Carlo simulation, setting up a 
database with information on weight of the power
system elements).

Finally, the money raised by the 'tax' does not all
go into a 'slush fund.' At Lewis, the director
does control a small discretionary fund. Each year,
any individual at Lewis can submit a proposal to
the director to get money from this fund to look
at pretty much anything within the Lewis Charter.

Most of the tax, however, goes to fund the 'general'
services at the Center, like the library, the 
central computer services division, the Contractor 
who removes the snow, etc. Thus, it is rather
difficult to determine what percentage of the
SSF budget doesn't go for SSF activities. To get
an accurate figure, you would have to take
the annual expenditure for the library (for example),
and then divide by the amount of the library funds
used to support SSF (which would be hard to
compute by itself - how would you figure out
what percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for
1 year is 'billable' to SSF, would you base it on
the person-hours SSF employees spend reading AV-week
versus the rest of the center personnel). You would
then have to compare this estimate of the SSF
portion of the library expense with the portion of
the tax that goes to support the library. Who knows,
maybe SSF overpays on the tax to run the library, but
we underpay for snow removal? Talk about
a burecratic nightmare!",space

seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part
in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has
pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest
on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!

It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while
Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next
best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at
.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team
is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game
and giving up 6.6/game. 

Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should
come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave
the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, 
Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be

held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,
the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen

most misleading statistic in baseball, far worse than RBI or R. that he
won 21 just means that the Jays got him a lot of runs.

I don't know what a ""low grade"" fusion reactor is, but the major
problem with 3He (aside from the difficulty in making any fusion
reactor work) is that its concentration in lunar regolith is just so
small -- on the order of 5 ppb or so, on average (more in some
fractions, but still very small).  Massive amounts of regolith would
have to be processed.

This thread reminds me of Wingo's claims some time ago about the moon
as a source of titanium for use on earth.  As I recall, Wingo wasn't
content with being assured that titanium (at .5% in the Earth's crust,
average) would not run out, and touted lunar mines, even though the
market price of ilmenite concentrate these days is around $.06/pound.
This prompted me to look up large potential terrestrial sources.

On the moon, titanium occurs in basalts; ""high-Ti"" basalts (Apollo 11
and 17) have 8-14% titanium dioxide (by weight).  This is nice, but...
terrestrial continental flood basalts are also typically enriched in
titanium.  They very often have 3% TiO2, frequently have 4%, and
sometimes even 5% TiO2 (again, by weight).  These flood basalts are
*enormous* -- millions of cubic kilometers, scattered all over the
world (Siberia, Brazil, the NW United States, Ethiopia, etc.).  If
even 1% of the basalts are 5% TiO2, this is trillions of tons of TiO2
at concentrations only a factor of 2-3 less than in lunar high-Ti
basalts.  It is difficult to see how the disadvantages of the moon
could be overcome by such a small increase the concentration of the
ore (never mind the richer, but less common, terrestrial ores being
mined today).",space

     Would you say the same thing about the Dodgers in '65 or '66?  True,
Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still,
these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with
lots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereas
Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.
     That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb
pitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of a
chance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no
pitching.  At least, to me.
     I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team
with Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real
order, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but
with a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.)
Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig,
Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.
     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by
seasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in
their best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all
the players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And all
the offense would have to do is get 1 run across.

Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the
#1 spot.

It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first
and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points
higher in both leagues than any other year.

Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.

Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin
Mitchell :->.

The other elite fielders in the league.

This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average.
His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of
that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the
Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and
judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play
third.

Add another to the elite fielders list.

Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know
what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low
1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988
(best year ever) brings his average up a lot.

Strange last two years.

According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base.
But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).

Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every
other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.

Last year -- a fluke or a portent?

Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close
to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?

Brook  is declining.

Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies
gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while
at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder
at third.

Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about
10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry
Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.

Moving back to second was a good idea.

So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total
of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.

Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit,
HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break
the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.

Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.

Not a good fielder.

Both are better off at shortstop.

Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to
have helped his fielding any.  

Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest
DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean.

            (Cards beat Mets, take first by 1 from Reds and Phillies)

Whew! what a finish! And the final standings were:

                 W     L    GB
St. Louis       93    69    -
Philadelphia    92    70    1
Cincinnati      92    70    1
San Francisco   90    72    3

Now it doesn't appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Short
were really overused, at least by the four-man rotation standard of
the day, until well along into the 10-game losing streak, at which
time Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the
Phillies substantial lead had evaporated. The way they were used at
that time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one
of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of
the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched
a complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It
would be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the
year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league.
Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1
through October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than
the other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that
stretch.

"The following are my thoughts on a meeting that I, Hugh Kelso, and Bob Lilly
had with an aide of Sen. Patty Murrays.  We were there to discuss SSTO, and
commercial space.  This is how it went...



After receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of SSTO,
I called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local Senator (D) Patty
Murray, Washington State.  I started asking for an hour, and when I heard
the gasp on the end of the phone, I quickly backed off to 1/2 an hour.
Later in that conversation, I learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes.

We got the standard bozo treatment.  That is, we were called back by an aide,
who scheduled a meeting with us, in order to determine that we were not
bozos, and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to 
make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material.

Well, I got allocated 1/2 hour with Sen. Murrays aide, and we ended up talking
to him for 45 minutes, with us ending the meeting, and him still listening.
We covered a lot of ground, and only a little tiny bit was DCX specific.  
Most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There was another
woman there who took copius quantities of notes on EVERY topic that
we brought up.

But, with Murray being new, we wanted to entrench ourselves as non-corporate
aligned (I.E. not speaking for boeing) local citizens interentested in space.
So, we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to
LEO.  Solar power satellites are a big focus here, so we hit them as becoming 
feasible with lower cost access, and we hit the environmental stand on that.
We hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collins Tourism
paper, with side notes being that everyone who goes into space, and sees the
atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEEING the smog
over L.A.  We hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification (which is 
more pronounced in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to 
understanding of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosis.  We hit the education 
whereby kids get enthused by space, but as they get older and find out that
they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there, they go on to other
fields, with low cost to orbit, the chances they might get there someday 
would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed.

We hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business
angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launches, gps navigation, personal
communicators, tellecommunications, new services, etc...  Jobs provided
in those sectors.

Jobs provided building the thing, balance of trade improvement, etc..
We mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs.

We left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order
to make this even easier to do.  And he asked questions on this point.

We ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are
proceeding in this area, and that we want to make sure that the
results from these efforts are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),
and most importantly, we asked that she help fund further efforts along
the lines of lowering the cost to LEO.

In the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data 
Purchase act, and the guy filed it separately, he was VERY interested in it.
He asked some questions about it, and seemed like he wanted to jump on it,
and contact some of the people involved with it, so something may actually
happen immediatly there.

The last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we
knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they
could feel free to call us any time with questions, and if we didn't know
the answers, that we would see to it that they questions got to people who
really did know the answers.

Then finally, we asked for an appointment with the senator herself.  He
said that we would get on the list, and he also said that knowing her, this
would be something that she would be very interested in, although they
do have a time problem getting her scheduled, since she is only in the
state 1 week out of 6 these days.

All in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.",space

    COMPUTING CRATER DIAMETERS FROM EARTH-IMPACTING ASTEROIDS

    Astrogeologist Gene Shoemaker proposes the following formula, based on
    studies of cratering caused by nuclear tests.

		     (1/3.4)
    D = S  S  c  K  W	    : crater diameter in km
	 g  p  f  n

	       (1/6)
    S = (g /g )		    : gravity correction factor for bodies other than
     g	  e  t		      Earth, where g = 9.8 m/s^2 and g	is the surface
					    e		      t
			      gravity of the target body. This scaling is
			      cited for lunar craters and may hold true for
			      other bodies.

		(1/3.4)
    S = (p / p )	    : correction factor for target density p  ,
     p	  a   t							    t
			      p  = 1.8 g/cm^3 for alluvium at the Jangle U
			       a
			      crater site, p = 2.6 g/cm^3 for average
			      rock on the continental shields.

    C			    : crater collapse factor, 1 for craters <= 3 km
			      in diameter, 1.3 for larger craters (on Earth).

							    (1/3.4)
    K			    : .074 km / (kT TNT equivalent)
     n			      empirically determined from the Jangle U
			      nuclear test crater.

	      3		   2		       19
    W = pi * d	* delta * V  / (12 * 4.185 * 10  )
			    : projectile kinetic energy in kT TNT equivalent
			      given diameter d, velocity v, and projectile
			      density delta in CGS units. delta of around 3
			      g/cm^3 is fairly good for an asteroid.

    An RMS velocity of V = 20 km/sec may be used for Earth-crossing
    asteroids.

    Under these assumptions, the body which created the Barringer Meteor
    Crater in Arizona (1.13 km diameter) would have been about 40 meters in
    diameter.

    More generally, one can use (after Gehrels, 1985):

    Asteroid	    Number of objects  Impact probability  Impact energy
    diameter (km)		       (impacts/year)	   (* 5*10^20 ergs)

     10			    10		     10^-8		10^9
      1			 1 000		     10^-6		10^6
      0.1	       100 000		     10^-4		10^3

    assuming simple scaling laws. Note that 5*10^20 ergs = 13 000 tons TNT
    equivalent, or the energy released by the Hiroshima A-bomb.

    MAP PROJECTIONS AND SPHERICAL TRIGNOMETRY

    Two easy-to-find sources of map projections are the ""Encyclopaedia
    Brittanica"", (particularly the older volumes) and a tutorial appearing
    in _Graphics Gems_ (Academic Press, 1990). The latter was written with
    simplicity of exposition and suitability of digital computation in mind
    (spherical trig formulae also appear, as do digitally-plotted examples).

    More than you ever cared to know about map projections is in John
    Snyder's USGS publication ""Map Projections--A Working Manual"", USGS
    Professional Paper 1395. This contains detailed descriptions of 32
    projections, with history, features, projection formulas (for both
    spherical earth and ellipsoidal earth), and numerical test cases. It's a
    neat book, all 382 pages worth. This one's $20.

    You might also want the companion volume, by Snyder and Philip Voxland,
    ""An Album of Map Projections"", USGS Professional Paper 1453. This
    contains less detail on about 130 projections and variants. Formulas are
    in the back, example plots in the front. $14, 250 pages.

    You can order these 2 ways. The cheap, slow way is direct from USGS:
    Earth Science Information Center, US Geological Survey, 507 National
    Center, Reston, VA 22092. (800)-USA-MAPS. They can quote you a price and
    tell you where to send your money. Expect a 6-8 week turnaround time.

    A much faster way (about 1 week) is through Timely Discount Topos,
    (303)-469-5022, 9769 W. 119th Drive, Suite 9, Broomfield, CO 80021. Call
    them and tell them what you want. They'll quote a price, you send a
    check, and then they go to USGS Customer Service Counter and pick it up
    for you. Add about a $3-4 service charge, plus shipping.

    A (perhaps more accessible) mapping article is:

	R. Miller and F. Reddy, ""Mapping the World in Pascal"",
	Byte V12 #14, December 1987

	Contains Turbo Pascal procedures for five common map projections. A
	demo program, CARTOG.PAS, and a small (6,000 point) coastline data
	is available on CompuServe, GEnie, and many BBSs.

    THREE-DIMENSIONAL STAR/GALAXY COORDINATES

    To generate 3D coordinates of astronomical objects, first obtain an
    astronomical database which specifies right ascension, declination, and
    parallax for the objects. Convert parallax into distance using the
    formula in part 6 of the FAQ, convert RA and declination to coordinates
    on a unit sphere (see some of the references on planetary positions and
    spherical trignometry earlier in this section for details on this), and
    scale this by the distance.

    Two databases useful for this purpose are the Yale Bright Star catalog
    (sources listed in FAQ section 3) or ""The Catalogue of Stars within 25
    parsecs of the Sun"" (in pub/SPACE/FAQ/stars.data and stars.doc on

there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them
when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to
the sun in a hyperbolic orbit. The magnitude of such accelerations he
estimated to be on the order of 700g. He also says that this is may not
be a big problem for manned craft because humans (and this was published
in 1986) have already withstood accelerations of 45g. All this is very
long-winded but here's my question finally - Are 45g accelerations in
fact humanly tolerable? - with the aid of any mechanical devices of
course. If these are possible, what is used to absorb the acceleration?
Can this be extended to larger accelerations?",space

in the very large discussion of kleros in done the to ""Theological Dictionary
of the New Testament"" by Bromley, is the meaning ""burial plot"" discussed.  It
discusses the forms of ""kleros"" (eg: kleros, kleroo, etc), and the various
meanings of ""kleros"" (eg: ""plot of land,"" and ""inheritance""), but mentions
nothing about CHORION or ""burial plot."" (Why does this not surprise me?) Thus
it would seem to be a very good thing you dumped Archer as a reference.]

I owe the group an apology.  It is my habit to check my articles before and
after their submission for errors.  In my last article I stated:
 
 
I was wrong. I admit that I do not have a handle on Greek grammar, and thus
confused ""kleros"", the second to last word in Acts 1:17 as being the plot of
land discussed.  In actuality it is ""chorion"", which is the last word Acts
1:18.  Unfortunately my Greek dictionary does not discuss ""chorion"" so I
cannot report as to the nuances of the word.

_____________________________________________________________________
 
HOW WOULD YOU EXPLAIN THE INACCURACY BETWEEN JUDAS HANGING
HIMSELF IN MATTHEW 27:5 AND ""FALLING HEADLONG HE BURST OPEN""
=============================================================
 
This question of the manner in which Judas died is one with which we are
constantly confronted in our travels. Many people point to the apparent
discrepancy in the two accounts as an obvious, irreconcilable error.
Some have gone so far as to say that the idea of an inerrant Bible is
destroyed by these contradictory accounts. However, this is not the case at
all.
Matthew relates that Judas hanged himself, while Peter tells us he fell and
was crushed by the impact. The two statements are indeed different, but do
they necessarily contradict each other?
Matthew does not say that Judas did not fall; neither does Peter say that
Judas did not hang himself. This is not a matter of one person calling
something black and the other person calling it white. Both accounts can be
true and supplementary.
A possible reconstruction would be this: Judas hanged himself on a tree on the
edge of a precipice that overlooked the valley of Hinnom. After he hung there
for some time, the limb of the tree snapped or the rope gave way and Judas
fell down the ledge, mangling his body in the process.
The fall could have been before *or* after death as either would fit this
explanation. This possibility is entirely natural when the terrain of the
valley of Hinnom is examined.  From the bottom of the valley, you can see
rocky terraces 25 to 40 feet in height and almost perpendicular.
There are still trees around the ledges and a rocky pavement at the bottom.
Therefore, it is easy to conclude that Judas struck one of the jagged rocks on
this way down, tearing his body open. It is important to remember that we are
not told how long Judas remained hanging from the tree or how advanced
was the decomposition of his body before his fall.
Louis Gaussen relates a story of a man who was determined to kill himself.
This individual placed himself on the sill of a high window and pointed a
pistol at his head. He then pulled the trigger and leaped from the window at
the same time.
On the other hand, a person could say that this man took his life by shooting
himself, while another could rightly contend he committed suicide by jumping
form the tall building. In this case, both are true, as both are true in the
case of Matthew's and Peter's accounts of the death of Judas. It is merely a
situation of different perspectives of the same event.

the passages.  But you haven't addressed why you feel that way.  You can say
it's a vain attempt to reconcile the contradiction, but that doesn't tell me it
didn't happen, nor have you shown why you reject that possibility.
 
Questions:  Is Matthew lying or is Luke lying?  Or are they both lying?  Or
are either or both of them misinformed?  Why do you think there is such an
alleged contradiction?  I do not think you have ever told us what you believe
in this respect.
 
DB...
""At present though, Mr DeCenso only asks two questions of me:
 
 
Actually I find question (1) to be a rather stupid request, but I will answer
it because he now restricts himself to two points.  First I would point out
that hanging is a very efficient manner for ending a life.  In fact it is a
bit of a fluke when someone survives hanging (except in fantasy cowboy
movies), and even then it usually referred to as an attempted hanging.""
 
MY REPLY...
I work at an agency that investigates child abuse and neglect.  Today, I got a
call re: a child that attempted suicide by hanging himself because his mother
is on crack.  He failed in his attempt and is in a child's psych ward at a
local hospital.  Hanging attempts are not always successful.
 
To assume that because most hangings are successful, this one was also is
""begging the question"", if I may quote you.

Research Institute's show, one of the scholars on there used several of these
terms that you use.  I am not all that familiar with them.  The man on the BAM
show teaches Comparative Religion and Logic.  It was interesting]

""This is so prevalent that, so that to say a man hung himself with no other
qualifiers is synonymous with stating that he killed himself.""
 
MY REPLY...
Qualifiers are important at times, as we'll see in an OT passage I'll mention
below.
Does hanging ALWAYS have this outcome?  Did Matthew, who is the only source we
have re: Judas hanging himself, state that Judas died as a result?  To say it's
synonymous means it has the same meaning as.  A boy (age 14) hung himself.  But
he lived.  This is only one of probably thousands of documented cases we can
discover.

Christian scholarly (including Greek scholars) opinion, I did some research.""

So it's OK to use Christian sources to back your points?  What about Tony's
position.  Do you value it or even consider it as a valid possibility?
 
Also, is it possible that the sources you read may be wrong, or lying, or
deceived in other parts of their books?  If so, should we do, as we have done
with Archer, toss them to the side and not value anything they say, including
their ""interpretation"" of the hanging of Judas?  I am sure _you_ would find
some errors and maybe even some deception in those sources.
 
You also noted they ""interpreted"" the hanging as meaning he died.  Although
that is very possibly true, do you find that in the text itself?  Remember,
that's the first criteria we must examine.

MY REPLY...
[^^^ above, mine]
No you can't only conclude this, although, as Tony says, this was a highly
probable outcome.  But Matthew does not state death as being a result.
 
The Greek word is APAGCHO.  Matthew 27:5 is it's only occurrence in the New
Testament.
 
In the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the OT used at the time of Jesus),
it's only used in 2 Samuel 17:23 : ""Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice was
not followed, he saddled a donkey, and arose and went home to his house, to his
city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself, and died; and he
was buried in his father's tomb.""             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
 
Notice that not only is it stated that Ahithophel ""hanged himself"" [Gr. Sept.,
APAGCHO], but it explicitly adds, ""and died"".  Here we have no doubt of the
result.
In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Judas died.
 
Also, there is nothing in the Greek to suggest success or failure.  It simply
means ""hang oneself"".

As I said in an earlier post...
 
_____________________________________________________________________
Although I still agree with Tony's exegesis as being the most probable
explanation regarding Judas' death (taking into account several criteria),
I've recently noticed some new things in Matthew.
 
MAT 27:5-8 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
and went and hanged himself. But the chief priests took the silver pieces and
said, ""It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the
price of blood."" And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's
field, to bury strangers in. Therefore that field has been called the Field of
Blood to this day.
 
First of all, notice that the text does not say that Judas died as a result of
hanging. All it says is that he ""went and hanged himself."" Luke however, in
Acts, tells us that ""and falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all
his entrails gushed out."" This is a pretty clear indication (along with the
other details given in Acts - Peter's speech, the need to pick a new apostle,
etc.) that at least after Judas' fall, he was dead. So the whole concept that
                                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here we have a stickler, Dave, that I have to say I just recently noticed.
Let's look at the passage in Matthew:
 
MAT 27:4 saying, ""I have sinned by betraying innocent blood."" And they said,
""What is that to us? You see to it!""
 
MAT 27:5 Then he threw down the pieces of silver in the temple and departed,
and went and hanged himself.
 
MAT 27:6 But the chief priests took the silver pieces and said, ""It is not
lawful to put them into the treasury, because they are the price of blood.""
 
MAT 27:7 And they consulted together and bought with them the potter's field,
to bury strangers in.
 
MAT 27:8 Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
 
Notice verse 5...""Then he...went and hanged himself.""
Matthew does not say Judas died, does it?  Should we assume he died as a
result of the hanging?                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
What does Acts say?
ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and
falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.
 
ACT 1:20 ""For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be
desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'
 
Here we may have a graphic explanation of Judas' death....So, my line of
reasoning to dispel your contradiction myth re:the ""two"" accounts of Judas'
death is this...Matthew doesn't necessarily explain how Judas died; he does
                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
say Judas ""hanged himself"", but he didn't specifically say Judas died in the
hanging incident.               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
However, Acts seems to show us his graphic demise.  Therefore, there is no
contradiction between Matthew and Acts re: Judas' `death'.

MY REPLY...
...we do know from Matthew that he did hang himself and Acts probably records
his death.  Although it's possible and plausible that he fell from the hanging
and hit some rocks, thereby bursting open, I can no longer assume that to be
the case.  Therefore, no contradiction.  Matthew did not say Judas died as a
                                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
result of the hanging, did he?  Most scholars believe he probably did, but...?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
______________________________________________________________________
 
I quoted all that to show that I highly regard the scholars' explanations, but
in looking at the texts initially, we can't assume Judas died.  It is, however,
highly probable.                            ^^^^^^
 
DB...
""By the way, while all agree that Judas died from the hanging, the books had
different ways of dealing with the contradiction we are discussing.  One
simply ignored it entirely and simply referred back to Matthew's version as
the correct version in both Matt and Acts.  ""The Biblical Knowledge Commentary""
suggested the hypotheses that Judas hung and then when he rotted, his belly
exploded (which doesn't explain his headlong fall), or that his branch or rope
broke, and he fell to his death and his gut gushed out (which doesn't explain
how a hanging man, would fall headlong rather than feet first).""
 
MY REPLY...
The outcome of any fall is dependent upon many factors...how high the person
was suspended before the fall, any obstructions such as tree branches that may
have deviated the fall, how steep an incline of rocky surfaces the victim fell
upon, thus possibly rolling or bouncing of several rocks, etc.  In a
superficial examination of the Acts passage and the Matthew passage, we are not
given a lot of info on the geographical specifics, but Tony in the above quoted
post gave us some...

Now truthfully, I do not see what is comforting about Matthew confusing the
source of the Potter's field prophesy, but on the other hand the author is
correct: Matthew does make that confusion.  Of course a Biblical inerrantist
who claim that every word of the Bible is guaranteed true by God, will have to
thereby add one more contradiction to the death of Judas (ie: where the
prophesy of the Potter's field came from).""

Please, when we are done with this study on his death, remind me to discuss
this with you.

As to your second question Mr DeCenso, you ask how we could be sure that the
money with which Judas purchased the land, was indeed for the betrayal, rather
than some other source.  I would point out that in Acts, where it specifically
mention ""the reward of iniquity"" [Acts 1:18], it also specifically mentions
what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Acts 1:16 ""...concerning
Judas who was guide to those who arrested Jesus."").  Now I would point out
that when the Bible describes an act of ""iniquity,"" and then immediately
discusses ""*the* reward of iniquity,"" it would be rather inane to suggest that
it was an action of iniquity other than the one discussed.""
 
MY REPLY...
Dave, we are getting somewhere, aren't we!
 
ACT 1:15 And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples
(altogether the number of names was about a hundred and twenty), and said,
ACT 1:16 ""Men and brethren, this Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy
Spirit spoke before by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide
to those who arrested Jesus;
ACT 1:17 ""for he was numbered with us and obtained a part in this ministry.""
ACT 1:18 (Now this man purchased a field with the wages of iniquity; and
falling headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his entrails gushed out.
ACT 1:19 And it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem; so that field
is called in their own language, Akel Dama, that is, Field of Blood.)
ACT 1:20 ""For it is written in the book of Psalms: 'Let his dwelling place be
desolate, And let no one live in it'; and, 'Let another take his office.'
 
Notice that in verse 16, the word ""iniquity"" is not used.  Rather, it states
that Judas ""became a guide to those who arrested Jesus"".
But the writer DID NOT stop there...vs. 17, ""for he was numbered with us and
obtained a part in this ministry.""  What part did Judas play in their ministry?
         ^^^^^^
JOH 12:6 This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a
thief, and had the money box; and he used to take what was put in it.
JOH 13:29 For some thought, because Judas had the money box, that Jesus had
said to him, ""Buy those things we need for the feast,"" or that he should give
something to the poor.
 
So, now we know what part Judas played - he was a treasurer, per se.
Right after Peter stated that Judas played a part in this ministry (treasurer,
according to John), THEN Luke adds the parenthetical explanation of ""wages of
iniquity"" - money that should have been put into the ministry, but was stolen
by Judas to purchase a field.  I believe this is a better exegetical
explanation of what the ""wages of iniquity"" are.  What do you think, Dave?

My query is:
	I have a HP workstation: HP Series 400 with X running on it.
I have a true color - 24bit color monitor connected to this machine.
Normally I have the capability to display 256 colors from a max of
16.7 million. Since the monitor is True Color I can see 16.7
million at a time. 
Que: do we have a facility in X(c-function call) that will enable me
to specify any RGB combination and see it on screen? I am using
XStoreColor to set the pallette of a max of 256 colors.
Que: If not. Is there any way I can display a true color image
on a true color monitor using XLib function calls?

We are generating ray traced images and 256 colors are indeed a
painful limit. besides I need the facility to display the true color images 
i will be generating on a true color system WITHOUT color 
quantification.
Please, if anyone can help i'd be obliged",graphics

I would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an
object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital
velocity.  For a target 300 km above the surface of Earth,
you need a delta-v of 2.5 km/s.  Assuming that rockets with specific
impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce, a rocket with a dry
weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel+oxidizer.
A small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or
birdshot (depending on the nature of the structure) would be
the payload.  I am sure the whole project is well within
the capability of the amateur rocketry community.

It sounds like a good Science Fair project--'Reduction
of Light Pollution Through Applied Ballistics'.
Or, it could be part of the Challenge Prize being discussed
here: $1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year
on the moon, $1 million for the first erradication of
an orbital eyesore/CCD burner.  I wouldpledge $1000
for the first person to bring it down, and I am sure
there are at least 999 other astronomers, nature lovers,
or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise.

Of course, a  Gerald Bull solution might be simpler.
(Either the solution Gerald Bull would apply--the use
of a large caliber gun; or the solution which was applied
to Gerald Bull--the use of a small caliber gun.)",space

Sorry I think I missed a bit of info on this Transition Experiment. What is it?

Will this mean a loss of data or will the Magellan transmit data later on ??

BTW: When will NASA cut off the connection with Magellan?? Not that I am
looking forward to that day but I am just curious. I believe it had something
to do with the funding from the goverment (or rather _NO_ funding :-)

"Sorry, the San Jose based Rosicrucian order is called A.M.O.R.C,

"Hi.

The RTrace ray tracer supports 3D text as a primitive, not collections of
spheres, cylinders and so on...
The 3D chars are made of lines and splines that are extruded...

Brian K., guess what?  You missed the point.  On a scale from cold to
hot, you are at 0 degrees Kelvin.


Then as you understand it, what is it?


Yes.  I agree with that.  But what does that have to do with Jesus?
Punishment you say?  Jesus did not regard his death as punishment. 


Good.  I wouldn't either--not the way you understand it.  


Ask Jesus himself.  He himself said why in John 12:23-32.  It
isn't a mystery to anyone and there certainly is no need for
a persuasive argument.   Read Jesus's own reply to your
question.

Jesus gives more reasons in John 16:7.  But one obvious reason
why Jesus died, (and as with everything else, it has nothing do with
his punishment) was that he could rise to life again--so that
we would ""stop doubting and believe"" (John 21:27).  The fact
that Jesus rose from the dead is my hope that I too will rise
from the dead.  It is an obvious point.  Do not overlook it.
Without this obvious point, I would have no hope
and my faith would be vanity.

Why did Jesus suffer in his death?  Again, ask Jesus.  Jesus
says why in John 15:18-25.   That's no mystery either.  ""The
world hates him without reason.""  It is a direct proclamation
of how far we humans botch things up and thus, how much we
need a Saviour.",religion
"<stuff deleted>

You mean like: seconds, minutes, hours, days, months, years. . .  :-)

Remember,  the Fahrenheit temperature scale is also a centigrade scale.  Some
revisionists tell the history something like this:  The coldest point in a
particular Russian winter was marked on the thermometer as was the body
temperature of a volunteer (turns out he was sick, but you can't win 'em all).
Then the space in between the marks on the thermometer was then divided into
hundredths.

"

No matter how ""absurd"" it is to suggest that a common moral system created by
mankind is absolute, it is not contrary to reason to suggest that a common
moral system created by mankind is sensible. In fact, for the Bible to be of
any use to mankind as a moral code, it must be interpreted by mankind and a
workable moral system created for everyday use.

The Jewish Talmud is the result of centuries of Biblical scholars analysing
every word of the Torah to understand the morality behind it. The Children of
Israel were given a very strict set of Moral, Civil, Judicial and Ceremonial
Laws to follow and yet this was clearly not enough to cover every instance
of moral dilemma in their Society. For a Christian, the situation is no better.

It seems to me that the only code of morality that we have from the Judeo-
Christian God is that which is contained in the Bible (which we can see from
the diverse opinions in the Christian newsgroups is not clear). There may well
be an absolute morality defined by the Judeo-Christian God for mankind to
follow but it seems that we only have a subset simply because the concept was
written down by man.

This leads to the problem of defining morality for our society. If we take the
divine Morality then we have a code of practice which may be interpreted in many
different ways (as an example, consider the immolation of heretics in the
fifteenth century and the interpretation of the Bible which allows a man to do
that to another man under the precept to administer Justice). If we take an
agnostic Morality then we have a code of practice that can be modified to suit
society (with all the danger that this implies). Alternatively, we could take
the basis of the Judeo-Christian morality and interpret/extend this to create
and justify a code of morality which suits the society we live in and enables
the people to live Righteously (as many Christian and Non-Christian philosophers
have done).

Whatever the driving force behind the definition of morality for our society, I
think the important aspect is the result.

Wow.  I was beginning to think that I had made that up.  I remember that

Fractal Landscape Generators
----------------------------

Public Domain:

  Many people have written fractal landscape generators. for example
  for the Mac some of these generators were written by
  pdbourke@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz (Paul D. Bourke).
  Many of the programs are available from the FTP sites and mail
  archive servers. Check with Archie.

Commercial:

  Vista Pro 3.0 for the Amiga from Virtual Reality Labs -- list price
  is about $100. Their address is:
	VRL
	2341 Ganador court
	San Luis Obispo,
	CA 93401
	Telephone or FAX (805) 545-8515

  Scenery Animator (also for the Amiga) is of the same caliber with Vista Pro 2.
  Check with:
	Natural Graphics
	P.O. Box 1963
	Raklin, CA 95677
	Phone (916) 624-1436

  Don't forget to ask about companion programs and data disks/tapes.

  Vista Pro 3 has been ported to the PCs.


CIA World Map II
----------------
[  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.
  If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the
  Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from
  the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with
  searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]

  Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)
  The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries
  in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360
  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for
  every half degree longitude and latitude.
 
  A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine
  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).
  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and
  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as
  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask
  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.
  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.
  (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to
  compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.

NCAR data
---------
  NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of
  terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at
  various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.
  This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending
  on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,
  IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive
  is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,
  email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.

UNC data tapes with voxel data
--------------
  There are 2 ""public domain"" tapes with data for the comparison and
  testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT
  scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.
  (softlab@cs.unc.edu)

  The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from
  omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD

NASA
----
  Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data
  from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,
  etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following
  address for more info:

     National Space Science Date Center
     Goddard Space Flight Center
     Greenbelt, Maryland 20771
     Telephone: (301) 286-6695
     Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov

  The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.
  Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.10.4) and log
  in as 'NODIS' (no password).

  You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,
  no parity, one stop). At the ""Enter Number:"" prompt, enter MD and
  carriage return. When the system responds ""Call Complete,"" enter a few
  more carriage returns to get the ""Username:"" and log in as 'NODIS' (no
  password).

  NSSDCA is also an anonymous FTP site, but no comprehensive list of
  what's there is available at present.

Earth Sciences Data
-------------------

  There's a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including
  imagery. This listing is called ""Earth Sciences Resources on Internet"",
  and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]
  in the directory COGS under the name ""internet.resources.earth.sci""

  Some sites include:
  aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - AVHRR images
  ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/SPACE/CDROM  - images from
        Magellan and Viking missions etc.
        pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole
        archive (the index is about 200K by itself). There's also an
        e-mail server for the people without Internet access: send a letter
        to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the
        subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:

        send SPACE Index
        send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91

        (Capitalization is important! Only text files are handled by the
        email server at present)

13. Background imagery/textures/datafiles
=========================================

 First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP
list above.

24-bit scanning:
----------------
  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for
  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :
  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll
  house supplies.
  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have
  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.

Books with textures:
--------------------
  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.
  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also
  a wide variety of stock art is available.
  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,
  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.

  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books
  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your
  graphics work. Their address is:
	Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,
	00196 Rome Italy,
	Piazzale Flaminio, 19
	Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60

Texture Libraries:
------------------
a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit
   textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit
   TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume
   (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.

   Contact:
   Mannikin Sceptre Graphics
   1600 Indiana Ave.
   Winter Park, FL 32789
   Phone: (407) 384-9484
   FAX: (407) 647-7242

b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine
   by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point
   versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.

==========================================================================

14. Introduction to rendering algorithms
========================================

a. Ray-Tracing:
---------------

  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read
  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would
  suggest:
   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press
     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4
  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong
  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines
  (erich@eye.com)

There's a more concise reference also:

  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: ""An Introduction to Ray Tracing"", in
  ""Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD"", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,
  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.

It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.

b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)
--------------------------

A good reference is:

        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,
        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.

15. Where can I find the geometric data for the:
================================================

a. Teapot ?
-----------

""Displays on Display"" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole
story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has
the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe
model of the teapot.

IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column ""Jim Blinn's Corner"" describes
an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for
example are used.

The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get
them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at
a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).
The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a
tessellation at any specified resolution.

b. Space Shuttle ?
------------------

Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle
datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):

model1:
A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)

406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)
389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).
Payload doors non-existent.
Units: unknown.

Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He
said there is no proprietary information associated with it.

model2:
The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in

gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo
hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data

model3:
The triangles' model.

This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.

Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did
not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.

model4:
The NASA model.

The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,
defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:

<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>

From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions

3473 vertices.
2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,
 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,
 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).
Payload doors closed.
Units: inches.

Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model
Proprietary info: unknown

model5:
The old shuttle model.

The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.

104 vertices.
452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).
Payload doors open.
Units: meters.

We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for
some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor
Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.

16. Image annotation software
=============================

a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in
  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored
  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a
  rasterfile.

b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some
  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not
  sure exactly what they are.
  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.

c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)
  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats
  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert
  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.
  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu
  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)

d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).
  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all
  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.

e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output
  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.

f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based
  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host
  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and
  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based
  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,
  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed
  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation
  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).
  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for
  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.

  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not
  be redistributed without permission.

  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that
  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of
  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging
  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.

g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the 
  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen 
  color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many
  of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as
  export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest
  X11 archive.

WIT
---
  In a nutshell it's a package of the same genre as AVS,Explorer,etc.
  It seems more a image processing system than a generic SciVi system (IMHO)
  Major elements are:

  - a visual programming language, which automatically exploits the inherent
        parallelism
  - a code generator which converts the graph to a standalone program

  Iconified libraries present a rich set of point, filter, io, transform,
  morphological, segmentation, and measurement operations.
  A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,
  synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.

  WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming
  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their
  imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware
  developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their
  own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers
  (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports
  Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

IDL/SIPS
--------
  ""A lot of people are using IDL with a package called SIPS. This was
  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working
  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL
  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I
  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general
  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.
  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose
  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I
  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh
  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image
  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've
  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best
  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large
  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a
  freebie if you want it""

  ""My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,
  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its
  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It
  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing
  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even
  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH
  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which
  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use
  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical
  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,
  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image
  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity
  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve
  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) ""

[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and
 for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder . From what I can
 understand, you can get packaged programs from Research Systems, though

SCRY
----
[ From the README : ]

      Scry is a distributed image handling system  that  pro-
 vides image transport and compression on local and wide area
 networks, image viewing on workstations, recording on  video
 equipment,  and  storage on disk.  The system can be distri-
 buted among workstations, between supercomputers and  works-
 tations,  and between supercomputers, workstations and video
 animation controllers.  The system is most commonly used  to
 produce  video based movie displays of images resulting from
 visualization of time dependent data, complex 3D data  sets,
 and  image  processing  operations.   Both  the  clients and
 servers run on a variety of systems that provide UNIX-like C
 run-time environments, and 4BSD sockets.

SVLIB / FVS
-----------
  SVLIB is an X-Windows widget set based on the OSF (Open Software 
  Foundation) Motif widget set. SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets 
  comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars, 
  menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability 
  of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an 
  encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap 
  manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted
  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only 
  color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets 
  developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget 
  set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers 
  using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other 
  Motif widgets.

  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) 
  simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these
  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these
  data graphically. 
  FVS accepts three-dimensional multi-block data recorded in NCSA HDF format.

GVLware Distribution:
        Bob  - An interactive volume renderer for the SGI
        Raz  - A disk based movie player for the SGI
        Icol - Motif color editor
---------------------------------------------------------

The Army High Performance Computing Research Center (AHPCRC) has been
developing a set of tools to work with large time dependent 2D and 3D
data sets.  In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using
these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the
Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies.
A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a
package called ""GVLware"".

GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available
via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive
volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to
an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.  Icol
is a color map editor that works with Bob and Raz.  Source and
pre-built binaries for IRIX 4.0.5 are included.

To acquire GVLware, anonymous ftp to:
        machine - ftp.arc.umn.edu
        file    - /pub/gvl.tar.Z

To use GVLware:
        mkdir gvl ; cd gvl
        zcat gvl.tar.Z | tar xvf -
        more README

Some Bob features:
        Motif interface, SGI GL rendering
        Renders 64 cubed data set in 0.1 to 1.0 seconds on a VGX
        Alpha Compositing and Maximum Value rendering, in perspective
            (only Maximum Value rendering on Personal Iris)
        Data must be a ""Brick of Bytes"", on a regularly spaced grid
        Animation, subvolumes, subsampling, stereo

Some Raz features:
        Motif interface, SGI GL rendering
        Loads files to a raw disk partition, then streams to screen
            (requires an empty disk partition to be set aside)
        Script interface available for movie sequences
        Can stream from memory, like NCSA XImage
        
Some Icol features:
        Motif interface
        Easy to create interpolated color maps between key points
        RGB, HSV and YUV color spaces, multiple file formats
        Communicates changes automatically to Bob and Raz
        Has been tested on SGI, Sun, DEC and Cray systems

BTW:    Bob  == Brick of Bytes
        Icol == Interpolated Color
        Raz  == ? (just a name)

Please send any comments to

18. Molecular visualization stuff
=================================

[ Based on a list from cristy@dupont.com < Cristy > , which asked for
 systems for displaying Molecular Dynamics, MD for short ]

Flex
----
  It is a public domain package written by Michael Pique, at The Scripps
  Research Institute, La Jolla, CA. Flex is stored as a compressed,
  tar'ed archive (about 3.4MB) at perutz.scripps.edu [137.131.152.27], in
  pub/flex. It displays molecular models and MD trajectories.

MacMolecule
-----------
  (for Macintosh). I searched with Archie, and the most
  promising place is sumex-aim.stanford.edu (info-mac/app, and
  info-mac/art/qt for a demo)

MD-DISPLAY
----------
  Runs on SGI machines. Call Terry Lybrand (lybrand@milton.u.washington.edu).

XtalView
--------
  It is a crystallography package that does visualize molecules and much more.
  It uses the XView toolkit.
  Call Duncan McRee <dem@scripps.edu>

landman@hal.physics.wayne.edu:
-----------------------------
  I am writing my own visualization code right now.  I look at MD output
  (a specific format, easy to alter for the subroutine) on PC's.  My
  program has hooks into GKS.  If your friend has access to Phigs for X
  (PEX) and fortran bindings, I would be happy to share my evolving code
  (free of charge).  Right now it can display supercells of up to 65
  atoms (easy to change), and up to 100 time steps, drawing nearest
  neighbor bonds between 2 defining nn radii.  It works acceptably fast
  on a 10Mhz 286.

icsg0001@caesar.cs.montana.edu:
------------------------------
  I did a project on Molecular Visualization for my Master's Thesis, using
  UNIX/X11/Motif which generates a simple point and space-filling model.

KGNGRAF
-------

KGNGRAF is part of MOTECC-91. Look on malena.crs4.it (156.148.7.12),
in pub/motecc.

ditolla@itnsg1.cineca.it:
------------------------
  I'm working on molecular dynamic too.  A friend of mine and I have

  developed a program to display an MD run dynamically on Silicon
  Graphics.  We are working to improve it, but it doesn't work under X,
  we are using the graphi. lib. of the Silicon Gr. because they are much
  faster then X.  When we'll end it we'll post on the news info about
  where to get it with ftp. (Will be free software).

XBall V2.0
----------
  Written by David Nedde. Call daven@maxine.wpi.edu.

XMol
----
  An X Window System program that uses OSF/Motif  for  the
  display and  analysis  of  molecular  model data.  Data from several
  common file formats can be read and written; current formats include:
  Alchemy, CHEMLAB-II, Gaussian, MOLSIM, MOPAC, PDB, and MSCI's XYZ
  format (which has been designed  for  simplicity  in  translating to
  and from other formats). XMol also allows for conversion between
  several of these formats.
  Xmol is available at ftp.msc.edu. Read pub/xmol/README for
  further details.

INSIGHT II
----------
  from BIOSYM Technologies Inc.

SCARECROW
---------
  The program has been published in J. Molecular Graphics 10
  (1992) 33. The program can analyze and display CHARMM, DISCOVER, YASP
  and MUMOD trajectories. The program package contains also software for
  the generation of probe surfaces, proton affinity
  surfaces and molecular orbitals from an extended Huckel program.
  It works on Silicon Graphics machines.

MULTI
-----
ns.niehs.nih.gov [157.98.8.8] : /pub - MULTI 3.0 (Multi-Process
		Molecular Modeling Suite)

+MindTool
+--------
+  It runs under SunView, and requires a fortran compiler and Sun's CGI
+  libraries. MindTool is a tool  provided  for  the  interactive  graphic
+  manipulation  of  molecules  and  atoms. Currently, up to 10,000
+  atoms may be input.
+  Available via anonymous FTP, at rani.chem.yale.edu, directory

19. GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)
===================================================

GRASS
-----
  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army
  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and
  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a
  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,
  although it is reported to have significant image processing
  capabilities.

  Feature Descriptions

  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the
  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source
  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass
  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using
  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who
  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very
  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software."" A first review  of
  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel
  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose
  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in
  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the
  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric
  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective
  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus
  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them
  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68

  Host Configuration Requirements

  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh
  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for
  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC
  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,
  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster
  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it
  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented
  in raster (grid-cell) form.

  Availability

  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:
  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).

  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to
  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.

  This location will be the new ""canonical"" source for GRASS software, as
  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.
  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and
  ""tar"" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John
  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,
  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review
  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently
  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be
  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu

  Support

  Listserv mailing lists:

  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level

  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.

Microstation Imager
-------------------
  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS
  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager
  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a
  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.

  Feature Description

  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.
  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a
  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).
  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.
  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering
  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,
  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages
  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band
  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.

  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle
  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available
  for GIS applications.
  Host Configuration Requirements

  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)
  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software
  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.

PCI
---
  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes
  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of
  remote sensing data in eight or ten different ""industry standard""
  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I
  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix
  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly
  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.

  The ""PCI software"" consists of several classes/groups/packages of
  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common ""PCI
  database"" disk file.  The ""Tape I/O"" package is a set of utility
  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape
  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the ""PCI database"" file;
  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can
  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several
  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap
  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type
  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically
  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and
  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.
  ""multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5""), and
  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't
  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your
  particular application/interest calls for.

  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight ""parameters,"" read from
  a common ""parameter file"" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your ""default
  directory.""  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same
  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting
  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a
  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to
  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,
  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also
  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's
  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled
  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI
  data structures (database file, parameter file).

  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but
  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the
  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle
  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a
  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the
  Macintosh calls ""raw"") data from tape, in a number of different
  ""interleave"" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the
  graphic-arts industry's ""CT2T"" format, would probably (I haven't tried)
  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT
  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start
  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI ""database"" file is designed to
  contain not only ""raster"" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map
  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of
  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often
  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,
  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this
  can go into the PCI ""database"").

  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX
  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific
  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to
  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would
  display directly from a PCI ""database"" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus
  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be ""overkill""
  in your case; it seems designed for the very ""high end""
  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice
  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's
  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which
  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe
  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these
  areas.

SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)
--------------------------------
  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis
  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed
  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels
  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since
  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging
  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.

  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and
  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).
  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement
  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.

  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may
  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame
  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X
  for display.

MAP II
------
  Among the Mac GIS systems, MAP II is distributed by John Wiley.

CLRview
-------
  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit
  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.

  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the
  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports
  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,
  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.

  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129)

Lindbergh's flight took place in '27, not the thirties.


Could you give examples of privately funded ones?


Your logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies.  However, the
concept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons, I 
suspect.  I'm not aware that Mr Orteig received any significant economic 
benefit from Lindbergh's flight.  Modern analogies, such as the prize for a
human powered helicopter face similar arguments.  There is little economic
benefit in such a thing.  The advantage comes in the new approaches developed
and the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the 
equivalent amount of direct investment would.  A person who puts up $ X billion
for a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it done
than because they expect to make money off the deal.",space

Unfortunately, elections can, and are, bought.  Promise the voters money, and

Same here.  Convicted felons may not legally purchase firearms.


That you know of.

While I lived in the DBR, a gang robbed a joint US Army/Bundewehr armoury and
got several hundred M-16s, ammunition, handguns and some explosives.  When I
left two years later, there were no clues.


Who uses them is the problem.  Crime, in the U.S., is ""no big deal"" if you are
the criminal.  How about 5 years for murder.  Credit for time served (in jail,
waiting for trial) and you are out in 12 months, worst case.  If we would put
criminals, especially violent ones, in the slam for true sentences, crime would
drop.  Instead, we reward them for being good and let them out early, very
early.


Serbs, Croats and Muslims have been killing each other almost since before the
invention of guns.  Old women are throwing stones at UN trucks.  This is a
hatred that goes beyond reason.

Yes, the problem is the user.  Question back (since you are one of the rational
ones):  If all gun crime were to stop, would you support dropping all gun
controls?


They did not believe, from experience, that the ""police"" (including National
Guard) could/would protect them.  Unless you want to argue that a human being
does not have a right to protect him/herself, they did the right thing.  What
would you suggest as a defense against a mob throwing bottles and rocks, and
also likely armed with stolen firearms?


Criminals would move to Scandinavia??? :-)  The average criminal would look for
a less hazardous job, and the rest would likely be buried at county expense.


Personally, I criticize the fools who send money to the IRA to ""make Ireland

I note that you make no such case as you claim can be 'even more
easily made'.  Yes, the argument can (and has) been made that current
government policy creates even larger market barriers than there were
in the first place, but there is no such term as 'government failure',
since the government can change policies whenever it pleases.  The
market doesn't do that and is governed by (relatively) well-understood
forces.  This libertopican bilge about 'moral arguments' about
taxation, etc., is, at bottom, so much simplistic economic thinking.
It can only be 'justified' by cliche derision of anyone who knows more

"NASA Headquarters distributed the following press
release today (4/6). I've typed it in verbatim, for you
folks to chew over. Many of the topics recently
discussed on sci.space are covered in this.

Gibbons Outlines Space Station Redesign Guidance

Dr. John H. Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and
Technology Policy, outlined to the members-designate of
the Advisory Committee on the Redesign of the Space
Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance to
the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of
the space station.

A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7
billion and a high option of $9 billion will be
considered by the committee. Each option would cover
the total expenditures for space station from fiscal
year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for
development, operations, utilization, Shuttle
integration, facilities, research operations support,
transition cost and also must include adequate program
reserves to insure program implementation within the
available funds.

Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within
the NASA budget for the President's new technology
investment. As a result, station options above $7
billion must be accompanied by offsetting reductions in
the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space
station option of $9 billion would require $2 billion
in offsets from the NASA budget over the next 5 years.

Gibbons presented the information at an organizational
session of the advisory committee. Generally, the
members-designate focused upon administrative topics
and used the session to get acquainted. They also
received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation
on the process the Station Redesign Team is following
to develop options for the advisory committee to
consider.

Gibbons also announced that the United States and its
international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese, and
Canadians -- have decided, after consultation, to give
""full consideration"" to use of Russian assets in the
course of the space station redesign process.

To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate
in the redesign effort on an as-needed consulting
basis, so that the redesign team can make use of their
expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR and the
possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and
systems. The U.S. and international partners hope to
benefit from the expertise of the Russian participants
in assessing Russian systems and technology. The
overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop
options for reducing station costs while preserving key
research and exploration capabilities. Careful
integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in
achieving that goal.

Gibbons reiterated that, ""President Clinton is
committed to the redesigned space station and to making
every effort to preserve the science, the technology
and the jobs that the space station program represents.
However, he also is committed to a space station that
is well managed and one that does not consume the
national resources which should be used to invest in
the future of this industry and this nation.""",space

It would seem to me that the act of possessing a machine gun is no less

to me that it would be better to pass laws that say, that if I harm

"Is there any doubt that this is true?  After a few down years, the A.L. East

team in baseball, and the Reds aren't bad either, they have nothing else.  The
Giants, Astros, and Padres all have talent, they do not have the all arounf

for the Rockies, who knows?
   The A.L. East has the defending champs, and although they lost a lot to
free agency, Toronto is still one of the best in baseball.  The Orioles have
the preseason favorite to win the Cy Young in Mike Mussina, and you can never
forget about Ripken.  The signings of Harold Baines and Harold Reynolds don't
hurt to much either, although I always liked Bill Ripken.  While they let a
lot go this summer (Randy Milligan, Joe Orsulak, Bill Ripken, Bob Milacki, Sam
Horn, Storm Davis, and Craig Lefferts), they kept the heart of their team
intact.

My predicted finish:
1. Baltimore (Could be a biased opinion)
2. NY Yankees
3. Toronto
4. Milwaukee
5. Detroit
6. Boston
7. Cleveland (Would have been higher if not for the accident)

"SSRT ROLLOUT

                Speech Delivered by Col. Simon P. Worden,
                     The Deputy for Technology, SDIO
                                    
                  Mcdonnell Douglas - Huntington Beach
                              April 3,1993

     Most of you, as am I, are ""children of the 1960's.""  We grew
up in an age of miracles -- Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles,
nuclear energy, computers, flights to the moon.  But these were
miracles of our parent's doing.  For a decade and more the pundits
have told us - ""you've lost it!""  The ""me"" generation is only
living on the accomplishments of the past.

     You and I have even begun to believe the pessimists.  We
listen in awe as the past generation tells of its triumphs.  Living
history they are.  We are privileged to hear those who did it tell
of it.  A few weeks ago some of this very team listened in awe as
General Bernie Schriever told of his team's work - and yes struggle
- to build this nation's Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.

     What stories can we tell?  Blurry-eyed telescopes?  Thousand
dollar toilet seats?  Even our space launch vehicles hearken only
of that past great time.  They are and seem destined to remain Gen.
Schriever's ICBMs.  I find it hard to swell with pride that the
best new space-lifter idea is to refurbish old Minuteman and
Poseidon ballistic missiles.

     Well - The pessimists are wrong.  The legacy is continuing. 
This event is proof.  To our technological parents: We've listened
to your stories.  We've caught your enthusiasm and can-do spirit. 
And we've learned from your achievements - and your mistakes.  Let
me honor one of you who was part of that history and the impetus
behind this history - Max Hunter.  You are one of the greatest
engineers of the firts great age of space exploration.  Your
insight and discipline built the Thor ICBM - later incorporated
into today's most successful launch vehicle - The Delta.

     You told us in the 60's that a new form of launch vehicle - a
single stage reusable rocket - can and should be built.  You
advocated this idea tirelessly.  It was elegantly simple, as are
all great breakthroughs.  You showed us how to build it.  You
convinced us it could be done.  You are working by our side to weld
its components into place.  Most important - you reminded us of a
prime engineering principle - undoubtably one you learned from the
generation before you - the generation that built transcontinental
aviation in the 1920's and 30's - build a little and test a little
and Max, you passed all of this on  to people like Pat Ladner who
started this program for the SDI.

     Douglas Aircraft didn't start with a DC-10.  They didn't even
start with a DC-3.  Our grandfathers built a little, tested a
little - even sold a little and made a little money - before they
moved on to the next step.  They didn't take a decade or more
before putting the first ""rubber on the road.""  Max Hunter - you
didn't take ten years to build Thor, and by God we're not going to
take ten years to show that low cost, single stage, reusable
aerospace transportation is real.

     We ended the cold war in a few short years.  It took the  same
team here today but a few years to show through the Strategic
Defense Initiative that the cold war must end.  We - you and us -
launched a series of satellites - The Delta experiments - in about
a year apiece.  This, more than anything else signaled our
commitment to end the impasse between ourselves and the Soviet
Union.  Those who made the decisions on both sides have underscored
the importance of our work in bringing about a new international
relationship.

     But it is the same team which is now  putting in place the
framework for an aerospace expansion that is our legacy for the
next generation.  We will make space access routine and affordable.

     We built this magnificent flying machine in two years.  This
summer a true rocket ship will take off and land on earth for the
first time.  Then we can and surely will build in the next three
years a reusable sub-orbital rocket.  It will allow us to use space
rapidly, affordably, and efficiently as no other nation can.  And
yes - we'll make a little money off it too!

     Then - and only then - we'll spend another three years to
build a fully reusable single stage to orbit system.  The DC-3 of
space will be a reality!  We may even be able to use some of the
rocket propulsion breakthroughs of our former cold war adversaries. 
What a wonderful irony if this SDI product and Russian efforts to
counter SDI merge to power mankind's next step to the stars!

     To be sure, we must guard against the temptations to leap to
the final answer.  Robert Goddard's first rockets weren't Saturn
V's!  If we succumb  to the temptation to ask  for just a few extra
dollars and a few more years to jump immediately to a full orbital
system - we will fail.  Max Hunter and his colleagues showed the
way.  Three years and a cloud of dust - in our case rocket
exhausts.  There is no short-cut.  If we expect to reshape the
world again - we must do it one brick at a time.  Minds on tasks at
hand!",space
"
I know.  You have this fucked up idea that anybody who prefers Alomar
to Baerga must be a Jay-Lover and Indian-Hater.  Sorry, you got that
one wrong!  I hate the Jays and don't care one way or the other about
the Indians.  But objectively, Alomar had the better offensive year
last year, so I have to pick him.

You admit T&P as a reliable(?), objective source?  Then you will note
that they rated Alomar as the better offensive player, chosing Baerga
over Alomar only because of his defense.

That's a joke!  (Alomar might not be a gold-glover, but he's certainly
no worse than Baerga defensively.)",sport

Um, what?  Eddie Murray was a superb first baseman for a *long* time.

Winfield as produced consistently for almsot 20 years, and excellently
on several occasions.  

Dave Kingman's *best* year was like Darryl Strawberry's *typical*
year with the Mets.  

Darrell Evans, too, did a whole lot more than just hit homers, which 
*is* all that Kong did.  



Whom are you talking about?  Yes, Eddie Murray is marginal, but that's
because he's 38 years old.  He wasn't marginal for a *long* time.



Not.  

Smith has hung around for a long time AND fielded the position better 
than anyone else ever has.

Yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago, in case you hadn't 
noticed.

One of his two MVP awards was as a centerfielder.



Like whom?  There are many players in the Hall who aren't anywhere near
as goos as the guys you're running down.


That's already the case, by some standards.  But the *bad* players in the 
Hall are all from the 20's and 30's.  Recent picks have generally been
excellent.


No, but who cares?  Was Stan Musial anywhere near as good as Babe Ruth?
Not really.  But he obviously belongs there.

The Hall has generally had about the top 1% of major leaguers.  As 
more players come through the game, more will be in that top 1%.  

And, yes, it's pretty easy to argue that Smith,. Yount, Evans, Winfield,
etc. are in the top 1%.  Dave Kingman on the other hand, was a liability
throughout most of his career.

Of course, Garvey *hasn't* gotten a lot of HOF press, so I don't know
what you mean.  

As for Ryan, is his W-L better than Morris'?  That's what a lot of voters
tend to look at.  And Morris *was* awfully good for a decade, and doesn't
lead MLB history in walks allowed, either.",sport

": I will clarify my earlier quote.  God's laws were originally written for 
: the Israelites.  Jesus changed that fact by now making the Law applicable to
: all people, not just the Jews.  Gentiles could be part of the kingdom of
: Heaven through the saving grace of God.  I never said that the Law was made
: obsolete by Jesus.

Just for reference, here's the earlier quote:
Malcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoads.ca) wrote in reference to Leviticus 21:9
and Deuteronomy 22:20-25:
: These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had
: expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a
: direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God
: is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately
: punishable.
: Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to
: God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in
: the age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There
: is repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And
: not just for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew
: and Gentile alike.

These are two conflicting statements.  To say one is a clarification of the
other is a breach of logic.  I don't mind people shifting their position on
an issue.  It irritates me when it is said under the premise that no change
was made.  What about Deuteronomy 22:20-25?  Is it wrong now?  Did Jesus
change that?

: If anything, He clarified the Law such as in that quote you made.  In the
: following verses, Jesus takes several portions of the Law and expounds upon
: the Law giving clearer meaning to what God intended.

Sure he does this.  However, he doesn't address the notion of stoning
non-virgin brides, because this needs no clarification.  Are you going to
deny that Deuteronomy 22:20-25 is not patently clear in its intent?

: I think you will agree with me that there are in today's world, a lot of
: modern-day Pharisees who know the bible from end to end but do not believe
: in it.  What good is head knowledge if there is nothing in the heart?

I'll agree that there is a lot of modern day Pharisees that know the Bible
from end to end and don't believe in it.  Depending on how they use this
knowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and
back it up with selected parts of the Bible.  Such Pharisees include David
Koresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify this by saying *I don't know* if
they actually believed what they were preaching, but the ends certainly
made the means look frightening.

However, just as scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, but
believe every word.  In fact, this is probably scarier, since there are far
more of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easy
to manipulate by the aforementioned Pharisees, since they don't know enough
to debate with these people.

: Christianity is not just a set of rules; it's a lifestyle that changes one's
: perspectives and personal conduct.  And it demands obedience to God's will.

No, it demands obedience to a book.  If God came down and personally told
me how I should behave, then I would say that I would be doing God's will
by doing it.  However, if preachers, pastors, and evangelists tell me to
obey the will of a book written by people who have been dead for close to
two millenia (even longer for the OT), even if I follow everything in it
with my heart, I could scarcely be honest with myself by saying I'm doing
the will of God.

: Some people can live by it, but many others cannot or will not.  That is
: their choice and I have to respect it because God respects it too.

Well, if God respects it so much, how come there is talk in the Bible about
eternal damnation for non-believers?  I see little respect eminating from
the god of the Bible.  I see a selfish and spiteful god.

: God be with you,

Not yours, thanks ;)

   {Description of ""External Tank"" option for SSF redesign deleted}


Yo Ken, let's keep on-top of things! Both the ""External Tank"" and
""Wingless Orbiter"" options have been deleted from the SSF redesign
options list. Today's (4/23) edition of the New York Times reports
that O'Connor told the panel that some redesign proposals have
been dropped, such as using the ""giant external fuel tanks used
in launching space shuttles,"" and building a ""station around
an existing space shuttle with its wings and tail removed.""

Currently, there are three options being considered, as presented
to the advisory panel meeting yesterday (and as reported in
today's Times).

Option ""A"" - Low Cost Modular Approach
This option is being studied by a team from MSFC. {As an aside,
there are SSF redesign teams at MSFC, JSC, and LaRC supporting
the SRT (Station Redesign Team) in Crystal City. Both LeRC and
Reston folks are also on-site at these locations, helping the respective
teams with their redesign activities.} Key features of this
option are:
  -  Uses ""Bus-1"", a modular bus developed by Lockheed that's
     qualified for STS and ELV's. The bus provides propulsion, GN&C
     Communications, & Data Management. Lockheed developed this
     for the Air Force.
  -  A ""Power Station Capability"" is obtained in 3 Shuttle Flights.
     SSF Solar arrays are used to provide 20 kW of power. The vehicle
     flies in an ""arrow mode"" to optimize the microgravity environment.
     Shuttle/Spacelab missions would utilize the vehilce as a power
     source for 30 day missions.
  -  Human tended capability (as opposed to the old SSF sexist term
     of man-tended capability) is achieved by the addition of the
     US Common module. This is a modified version of the existing
     SSF Lab module (docking ports are added for the International
     Partners' labs, taking the place of the nodes on SSF). The
     Shuttle can be docked to the station for 60 day missions.
     The Orbiter would provide crew habitability & EVA capability.
  -  International Human Tended. Add the NASDA & ESA modules, and
     add another 20 kW of power
  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability. Add a 3rd power module,
     the U.S. habitation module, and an ACRV (Assured Crew Return
     Vehicle).

Option ""B"" - Space Station Freedom Derived
The Option ""B"" team is based at LaRC, and is lead by Mike Griffin.
This option looks alot like the existing SSF design, which we
have all come to know and love :)

This option assumes a lightweight external tank is available for
use on all SSF assembly flights (so does option ""A""). Also, the 
number of flights is computed for a 51.6 inclination orbit,
for both options ""A"" and ""B"".

The build-up occurs in six phases:
  -  Initial Research Capability reached after 3 flights. Power
     is transferred from the vehicle to the Orbiter/Spacelab, when
     it visits.
  -  Man-Tended Capability (Griffin has not yet adopted non-sexist
     language) is achieved after 8 flights. The U.S. Lab is
     deployed, and 1 solar power module provides 20 kW of power.
  -  Permanent Human Presence Capability occurs after 10 flights, by
     keeping one Orbiter on-orbit to use as an ACRV (so sometimes
     there would be two Orbiters on-orbit - the ACRV, and the
     second one that comes up for Logistics & Re-supply).
  -  A ""Two Fault Tolerance Capability"" is achieved after 14 flights,
     with the addition of a 2nd power module, another thermal
     control system radiator, and more propulsion modules.
  -  After 20 flights, the Internationals are on-board. More power,
     the Habitation module, and an ACRV are added to finish the
     assembly in 24 flights.

Most of the systems currently on SSF are used as-is in this option, 
with the exception of the data management system, which has major
changes.",space

Having lived, played, and worked on and near the Navajo reservation
for a number of years, I can confirm this is an ancient pattern,
found in petroglyphs dated 800 to 1200 years old.

Also, the Indians never stopped making rugs with this pattern - they
just stopped selling them after the Nazi's pre-empted the swastika.

Note also that the Indian versions use both clockwise and
counter-clockwise swastikas.

Ob guns:  It's the rare Navaho family that doesn't own a rifle. 
They remember being ""relocated"" by the US Army, and don't intend to
do it again.  The Hopi, on the other hand, have a dislike for
weapons, from my experience.  Perhaps they just hide them better

Hello,

	I understand this philosophy.  The bears are a national
treasure, the area is their sanctuary and people who enter it
do so at their own risk.  It is better that that rare human be
killed by a bear than that bears be provoked or shot by unbear-savvy
visitors.  The bears aren't having a population explosion, humans
are so it is better that a human be killed than endanger the bears.
I don't agree with this philosopy, but I understand it.

	The psychos are a bit different.  They are not a national
treasure but I suppose the decision has been made that to ""allow""
provision for defense against them would also ""allow"" provision
for defense against bears.  Again, I suppose it has been decided
that it is better for the rare human to be killed by a psycho than
to take a chance on threatening the bears.

	Personally, I wouldn't go into an area where I would be
""managed"" so as to reduce my safety ..... but ... come to think
of it I guess I live in a managed wilderness myself :-)",politics

"Disclaimer -- This is for fun.

In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called
""stolen hits"", defined as a play made that ""an average fielder would not
make with average effort.""  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted
by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats
for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as ""Plays Kurt
Stillwell would not have made.""

OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,
fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we
replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out
making ability, how many extra hits would go by?

To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net
Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league
average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double
Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).

Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or
DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.
I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which
should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't
take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this
article.

The short version -- definition of terms
HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell
NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder
NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder
NEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder
DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.
DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.

DCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)
Why such a bizzare formula?  Basically, it's designed to be added into the
OPS, with the idea that ""a run prevented is as important as a run scored"".
The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are 
factored into SLG.  That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors.

Actually, they're pretty worthless, if you want to evaluate players
with stats.  RBIs and Runs Scored should be banned; all they do is
confuse victims of mediot brainwashing like yourself.  

  You


Uh, so?

You've just explained why we use OBP and SLG to evaluate players.
Precisely because the team that scores more runs wins the game.
Traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods
which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored - that's
where OBP, SLG, Runs Created, Linear Weights, etc. come in.  These
simplify matters so that we can more easily measure a player's
offensive contribution to the team's runs scored.

	Would *you* have come out if you knew the only national TV

Stop! Hold it! You have a few problems here. Official history says that 
the first accusations of homosexuality in the SA came from OUTSIDE of the Nazi 
party, long BEFORE the Nazis ever came to power. So this objection is a red
herring, even if established history is wrong on this point. Moreover, none of 
the histories I've read ever made mention of Hitler or anyone else ever using 
homosexuality as a pretext for purging Roehm. A point I saw reiterated was that
Hitler and the party covered up these accusations. If you are going to accuse
official history of being a fabrication, you should at least get your facts
right. The pretext for purging Roehm was that he was planning to use the SA in
a coup against Hitler. Nowhere is there mention of using allegations of
homosexuality as a pretext for the purge, nor as a justification afterwards (it
is possible that the histories I've read have not mentioned this, but I doubt
it - would it be in Hitler's best interest to admit to the world that his
former right hand man was a homosexual?). 

Anyway, as I said before, it is always possible that I have missed references 
to the Nazis making use of charges of homosexuality against the SA after the 
night of the long knives - but this does not prove that they were false. Even 
the Nazis could tell the truth when it was to their advantage. In any case, 
this does not deal with accusations of homosexuality in the SA during the 
1920's.


Ah, yes. I forgot this was being posted to alt.conspiracy. I can smell the
paranoia from here. Since the Nazis never officially charged Roehm with 
homosexuality (at least, not according to what I've read), I'd like to know 
what tainted ""evidence"" you are talking about. Since the accusations were made 
by persons outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those 
accusations were common knowledge to journalists and others in Germany in the 
1920's and 30's, just how would it be possible for the Nazis to go back in 
time and plant ""tainted"" evidence? How exactly does one doctor newspapers 
which were circulated around the world, without the discrepancies being 
obvious? What actual incidences of Nazi doctoring evidence on this matter
do you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involved in 
these matters, some of whom were not Nazis? And what is the point of making a 
false accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point 
here seems to be to discredit established history, then the burden of proof 
falls on the revisionist. The revisionists had better do their homework 
before making accusations. Otherwise they simply look like conspiracy nuts.


This is just about the *only* thing we agree on. 

I suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and 
his SA buddies - who were homosexuals must disturb some people. The feeling
seems to be that if a nasty individual is accused of homosexuality, that this
must be an attempt to bash homosexuals. This fear - often justified - is what
lies behind this distrust of official history, or so it seems to me. But this
is not a good justification for trashing accepted accounts of this subject. If 
you really think that historians are so incompetent, why don't you write them 
and ask where they got their sources on this subject, if you can't tell from 
their footnotes? I'm a graduate student in history. Writing to professors and
tracking down sources is old hat. But my time is limited and this is not my
specialty - and neither you nor anyone else have said anything that would
cast one shred of doubt on existing evidence. I'm not going to waste my time
trying to debunk someone's paranoia. Do the research yourself.


Given that you already consider all evidence ""tainted"", what on earth would
constitute concrete particulars? And since when have concrete particulars been
considered ""shrewd guesses""?

I suggest that those who do not trust popular historians (Irving et al) -
historians writing for a popular audience do not, as a rule, provide copious 
footnotes - should try instead reading academic historians, who usually 
provide footnotes to all their sources in immmense detail. This is the place 
to start looking. Assuming that one really wants to know the truth.

I'll bet the folks on alt.pagan are tired of this subject already. My
apologies - we seem to have gone off on a bit of a tangent. I forget which gods
are responsible for keeping strings within appropriate newsgroup subject
boundaries...",religion

"****************************   SPHINX   ***************************

	Sphinx is a user-friendly, state-of-the-art image processing
and analysis package that runs across a spectrum of high performance 
computer platforms operating UNIX and the X-Window System.

	It was created to meet to the daily research needs of scientists 
conducting climate investigations using satellite data and remote
sensing techniques. 

		   Intuitive Graphic Interface

	Sphinx features an interactive interface with pop-up menus and 
point-and-click dialog boxes which makes image processing and
analysis simple and fast.
	This accessible menuing enables you to build attractive image 
layouts quickly while also providing you the flexibility of returning
to the main menu to conduct other image analysis and processing operations.

		    Image Format Compatibility

	Using smart read/write functions, Sphinx allows you to easily open
and save image files in a variety of formats using bit, integer or real
data values.  Sphinx also reads and writes the common TIFF and GIF formats
as well as compresses and decompresses image formats to save disk space.

		    Image Analysis & Processing

	For image and pixel analysis, the Sphinx package includes an
assortment of processing tools that perform useful statistical and 
mathematical filtering operations, such as Fourier transforms, convolution 
product or principal component analyses.
An interactive interpreter for both algebraic equations and images allows
the user to manipulate and combine individual data channels interactively.
Standard FORTRAN notation is used for formula entry and for trig
onometric and transcendental functions.

		    Satellite Spectra & Orbit Analysis

	Sphinx possesses functions to simulate satellite signal sensitivity
for various meteorological satellites (e.g., GOES, METEOSAT, NOAA, Spot etc.).
The simulations are conducted for a selection of standard atmospheric and
surface conditions and instrument spectral bands.
A geometry model computes the solar zenith angles, warping, orbit simulation,
and 3-D image projection.

		    Easy External Program Interfacing

	Sphinx allows users the flexibility to integrate externally
developed software algorithms for processing and converting satellite
observations.  Sphinx exports and imports image files and image parameters
to external programs using special interface functions.

		    Quick Quality Presentation

	Sphinx rapidly displays, manipulates, and enhances high-resolution
multispectral images and color tables.  Using six 8-bit 1024x1024 image
planes and one graphics plane, the package conveniently combines color images,
graphics and text to generate sharp digital images for articles and reports.
Sphinx's 2-D and 3-D graphics editor provides complete flexibility for modifying
and integrating vector graphics and analysis plots with images, such as 
histograms and radial graphs.  The package supplies color and gray scale
output for standard inkjet and laser printers.
	Other Capabilities Sphinx also performs image animation, external 
graphics importing, mosaic fitting... what else?

		    Software Support & Development

	 Sphinx was developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmospherique (LOA)
 of the Universite de Lille, France.
The package has received critical feedback and support from scientists at
the French national laboratory, Centre National de Recherche Scientifique (CNRS),
and the French space agency, Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES).
At LOA, Sphinx undergoes continued refinement and development to meet changing
research needs and advances in computer technology.  The package, which features
on-line help, is supported by an Internet address

 sphinx@loasil.citilille.fr through which questions can be answered and
 version updates provided without delay.

		    Performance Tested

 	CNES has selected Sphinx to analyze and process the satellite data 
collected during the upcoming ADEOS/POLDER satellite mission.  Today,
the Sphinx package is in use at the NASA - Goddard Space Flight Center
and is widely used in many French laboratories, including
the Centre de Recherche en Physique de l'Environnement, Ecole Normale Superieure ,

Kenny Lofton, Chris Hoiles, Keith Mitchell, Tim Wakefield, and a bunch

I'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  It appears that in
a neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two
home runs).  Or do they?  What is ""equivalent average?""

One thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took
away some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for
doubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you
expect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, 
hit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his
value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  


Felix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park.
I would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player.
Maybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.


I'd put him about there too.  

Note: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he
was always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so 
at baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't
winning.

Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a
mistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)
with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).

We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major
and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.
Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;
the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent
the player has left college ball, etc.

Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of ""error.""  Sometimes
a player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.
Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe
McDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are
real reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)
involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting
and so on.

But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.
One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background
of the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is
that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing
ball.  Their backgrounds are similar.

What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player
with a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a
Bo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so
on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard
assumptions fit this person slowly?

It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.
(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after
all, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually
make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.
""Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,"" they say.  Well,
what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?
It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than
Tuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in
Atlanta than Greenville.  

Then again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank
this year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's 
worse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are 
other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties 
again.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not.
It's got some error.

Oh well.

      Tennessee, at least, does not require any sort of safety class to

      In all probability, no you don't.  You are required to be licensed
to drive on public roads.  A license is not necessary on private property.


       Most states do not require the registration of cars that are
not used on public roads.  Those that do (California I know of) do

     LOCAL NATIONAL SPACE SOCIETY CHAPTERS SPONSOR TALK BY L.A.
  ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD

   On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National 
Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co-
inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D.
Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science
Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.

   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space
Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell
International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world
authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or
coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial
materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David
Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.

   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal
experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build
the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a
potential to power the globe.

   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half
from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific
concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.

   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar
surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted
through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous
source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever
increasing demand using proven, basic technology.

   OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space
Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the
National Space Society, which is an international non-profit
organization that promotes development of the space frontier.
The Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.

"Today's atrocity in Waco has finally impelled me to start working on
something I've been thinking about for some time.  Over the last few
years I have heard of one case after another of government running
completely amok.  Unfortunately, most people are oblivious of the
government's crimes and still think of it as their protector.  So I
intend to put together what I call the ""American Horror File"": a
compilation of cases where the American government has run roughshod
over the rights of its citizens over the last few years, focusing
especially on deaths and injuries resulting from no-knock warrants,
and financial ruin to innocents resulting from civil forfeiture laws,
but including any other cases for which I can find decent
documentation.  I hope to make people blood-boiling, artery-bursting,
red-hot enraged at their government.

The end result will probably be a book in electronic form (ASCII text
and postscript files) detailing the government's crimes of recent
years.  This book will be distributed at cost, and I will encourage
people to post copies to BBS's, send copies on disk to friends, and
print out copies and give them to neighbors.

This is a call for your help.  Any information that you can send me on
how government is running amok will be greatly appreciated.  I would prefer
information that is well-documented, with sources given, about specific
instances of governmental abuses.  I also welcome anyone who wants to
join me in collecting and researching information for this project.

	That's OK -- you can mail me if you want more discussion.


	Around here, long-guns are proof of age and fill out the forms.
For pistols, nation-wide check for felonies and three days wait.  The
""good reason"" is the difference, and one Americans tend to get annoyed
over as we see no reason the guy with the badge is any better than us.


	Not when dealing with America.  I can drive an 18-wheel truck
with no permit, no license, and at age 12 if I'm engaged in farming
work.  Strange, that, but there is little to no problem with this.
Again, personal rights versus collective security.


	Strange that the rates would decline, since killing somebody
is much more frowned upon than merely stealing a gun.


	Why attract attention?  I carry my sword openly to and from
practice, as that is the only legal thing I can do.  I also attract
a lot of attention doing this.  I'd rather be lost ""in a crowd of one""
than be the subject of attention while carrying a weapon.  Think of
the word ""intimidation"" and you can see where intimidation is not
the preferable method for the normal citizen.


	Aggressive towards whom?  Southerners?  Germans?  Precisely
why I think your society is less violent, weapons aside.


	Then the masses have the same rights as the individuals, because
everything comes down to the individual in one instance or another.  To
draw an analogy, Norway is involved in the EEC.  The USA in involved in
NATO.  The EEC requires certain changes in your laws.  NATO requires
no such changes in USA law.  These laws affect citizens, and hence
Norway is saying Europe is more important than, say, Norwegians having
motorcycles that make over 100bhp.  In the USA, we'd likely tell the
EEC to get stuffed since the EEC has no business, in our eyes, in
telling us how much horsepower we can safely ride.  While I note
that our own state governments often play with game with the federal
government, in essence this is a cultural difference between us.


	It shouldn't.  Since neither of our countries has managed to
remove criminals from society, in America we feel (and remember we
have individual states that are larger than your country) that if the
police cannot protect us then we must do so ourselves.  The criminals
in our country are quite violent, hence we prepare for them.


	We don't.  E-mail me to find out just how difficult it really
is in this country.  It is easier than in yours, but theft is far
easier than the troubles we go through to purchase over here.


	They are neither.  They are an option.  We would never force
you to own guns if you lived here.  We would, however, fight to keep
that option open to you.


	Then you show you are a responsible, rational user of weapons.
Welcome to our ranks.  Now, how do we teach the young people this sort
of responsibility?  Cultures seem to have a grave impact here.

"
Is the license required for driving a car exclusively on private
property, such as a farm? Here in the United States, the license
is required only for the use of public roads.


We also have a nation of 250 million people, _many_ issues and
usually only two candidates for a given office. A President
might be willing to abuse mild gun control laws and create
a de-facto ban (something a majority of the people would object to)
and still be elected: The voters might look at issues like the
civil rights of minorities, health care, etc... and vote
for the ""lesser of two evils."" I don't think this is a matter
of paranoia, since local governments in (for example) New York
and Chicago have abused existing, mild gun control laws to 
create a virtual ban.


In which case, the United States already has adaquate gun control laws:
According to federal statistic, only 7% of gun-wielding criminals
legally purchase their own guns from licensed dealers. If that's
the point of gun control (to prevent criminals from legally purchasing
guns) then America doesn't need any additional laws to accomplish
this.


How is this any different from guns? There are legal purposes for
owning and using a gun: They are appropriate tools for hunting,
target shooting and self-defence. Like cars, murder isn't
their only (or even a common) use.


I certainly couldn't imagine the American public accepting regulation
of axes. While the politics of other nations may be different,
in America there is strong opposition to any intrusive law that
primarily would effect the average, law-abiding citizen who had
not done anything wrong.


A good way to deal with which problem? It is an excelent way to deal 
with the short-term problem of rioting and violent attacks. Of course,
it doesn't do anything for the long-term issues that start riots. But
at this point, what can these individuals do about long-term social
problems? 


There are, according to surveys, guns in 40% of American homes.
In many parts of the country, this is closer to 100%. Those places
where almost everyone owns a gun are, on average, safer than those
where guns are less common.


This is, I think, a fundamental difference between American government
and that of other nations. Here it is not acceptable to punish
or restrict the average, law-abiding citizen in the name of some
vague ""common good."" ",politics

You're getting warmer.  The 'little thing in the trigger' has to be
depressed before the trigger can move.  What this means is the damned
thing won't go off until the trigger is pulled.  This makes it just
about (there HAVE been some problems, but we're assuming the gun is
functioning correctly..) as safe as a revolver.  The gun when working
correctly is totally drop safe.

Now, in police work this is a consideration.  There is not a single
documented case I'm aware of where a police officer was killed because
he failed to operate the safety on his firearm.  There are quite a few
documented cases where criminals got hold of the cops gun and couldn't
figure out how to get the safety off in time to use the gun, thus the
proprietary nature of the safety (to the criminal at least) very likely
prevented the office from getting shot.

The purpose of a safety is to make the gun safe from unintentional fire.
This does not mean it should be so complicated as to slow down
intentional use!  Thus the Glock safety is perfectly adequate from a
'safety' standpoint, but not necessarily the most desirable from the
standpoint of open carry where it is easily grabbed by somebody else.
By this criteria it DOES make a lot of sense as a concealed carry piece.
From the standpoint of police use, it is no better (or worse) than a
revolver as far as being 'proprietary' to the officer in the method of
firing it.

The ideal solution may someday be biometric sensing of the user so that
the firearm can't be used by anybody but it's owner, but for now the
wide variety of safety systems helps, unless the criminal happens to be
familiar with that particular type of firearm.",politics
"In <lsjc8cINNmc1@saltillo.cs.utexas.edu> turpin@cs.utexas.edu (Russell Turpin)


I regard love as no more or less ""benign"" than any other Christian does.
You are merely expressing ""approval"" of the consequences I find therein.
Which says more about our politics and cultural trappings than about my
(or any) religion.  ""Love"" is a highly ambiguous word, of which Christians
can write both the ""gentle"" words Paul uses of it in 1 Corinthians -- in
a passage that even the ""conservatives"" will quote at you :-) -- and the
words of T. S. Eliot in his Pentacost Hymn, ""Love is the unfamiliar Name
that wove the intolerable shirt of flame ...""

This is in any case rather to the side of what I was attempting to raise
in my note, as will become more evident below.


blechhh.  I think you are misreading me, rather seriously.  Though,
given my principle that one CANNOT force one's own notion of ""sin"" on
another, and my unshakeable ""disestablishmentarianism"", Russel Turpin
and others (believers and unbelievers alike) are under no threat of my
legislating my own understanding of Christian love.


You misread.  I can do (and have repeatedly done) a complete bill of
accusation against the Inquisition by exhibiting in as thorough a form
as anyone might want a demonstration of the harm it has done to human
beings (in the first place) and to respect for (let alone love of) ""God""
in near succession.  Please go back to my quoted words above:

The ""possibility that always exists"" is that I (or, to revert to proper
time sequence, my predecessors over the last several centuries) could
persuade ""Christian B"" of my case that the Inquisition *does* indeed
constitute an egregious violation of the Law of Love.  I must also note
that the majority of Christians HAVE been so persuaded.  By Christian
argumentation, as well as by secular [both Christian and non-Christian]
prohibitions.

What Mr. Turpin alludes to is a trickier point:

	A.  I demonstrate the human pain and violation of love involved
	    in the Inquisition.

	B.  The Inquisitor responds that Mother Church must, however
	    painful this *seems*, ""discipline"" her children for their
	    own good -- in this case the salvation of their souls (or
	    if the tortured heretic will not recant, than by bad example
	    ""deterring"" others from the same loss-of-soul.)

	A.  I point out that this ""justification"" of a failure in love
	    depends on a highly speculative construal of texts and of
	    philosophical assertions that are quite undemonstrable.

	B.  Burns me at the stake.

My rhetoric has failed, but the point I am making is sustained.  What is
going on here has a *lot* to do with ""cultural baggage.""  In this case,
the baggage includes a (nearly universal, and absolutely secular) belief
that an accused person must prove innocence and that testimony is most
believable if taken under torture.  The elimination of Inqisitorial
practice (in those places where it *has* been eliminated, or at least
greatly reduced) has very little, if anything, to do with the discussion
of sin in the exchange between A and B.

Mr. Turpin is pointing out that, if I am A versus the Grand Inquisitor's B,
then my persuasion is not very likely to work.  I know this; and in what-
ever personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghostly defense
attorney.  So, ""one possibility"" fails in this case -- as it will fail in
may others.  At the other extreme, the ""persuasion"" will succeed when it
properly SHOULD not, if it entails mistaken assumptions I share with the
Inquisitor.  And that is potentially an even more troubling case, in that
many of the victims of Inquisition will have ""accepted"" that they were in
fact sinful (in such random cases as they may actually have been guilty
of charges brought against them.)

The point is that the ""persuasion"" breaks down when the parties do NOT
share enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main
thrust of the Inquisition, against ""heresy"", it is *bound* to break down
in precisely the ""worst"" cases.  The ""conservative"" (I don't think that
is the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,
that he is ""justified"" in causing harm because he *thinks* that works to
a ""greater good.""  But this is a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow
the gospel, as if one's theories about ""sin"" entitled one to cast aside
Jesus' words on dealing with sinners (cf. Matthew 5:39ff).

I am a ""radical"" Christian *only* in that I take the gospel seriously.


Well, the whole *point* of making these the ""base"" commandments is that
they *aren't* reducible to rules.  A set of rules is a moral code or a
law code or an algorithm for acting.  Such things can be very helpful
to individuals or societies -- but not if they are used *instead* of a
personal involvement in and responsibility for one's actions.  The Great
Commandment is, more than anything else, a call to act *as if you were
God and accepting ultimate responsibility* in your every action.  A
demand that I, like most, would rather *not* hear, but it keeps popping
up nonetheless (along with the reassurance that it is more important
that I be open to trying this, than succeeding at it).  ""Conservatives""
may twist this ""act as if you were God"" to mean ""lay down rules for other
people and be as nasty to them as possible if they don't keep YOUR rules.""
They are so insistent (and obvious) about this that they have convinced a
lot of people (who rightly reject the whole concept!) that such idiocy
IS how God acts.  That, after all, is the standard accusation ""against
God"" by the atheists here and elsewhere.  That the ""conservatives"" have
confused THEIR manipulative, hoop-jumping notions of coercing other
people with the Nature of God is almost the entire content of standard
American atheism -- and I quite agree with it on this point.


And different bodies of Christians have, from the beginning, urged
*different* ""ethical systems"" (or in some cases, none).  As a result,
it is bizarre to identify any one of these systems, however popular
(or infamous) with Christianity.  Christianity DOES NOT HAVE A TORAH.
It does not have a QU'RAN.  Specifically Christian scripture has very
little, if anything, in the way of ""commandments"" -- so little that
the ""Christians"" who desperately *want* commandments go ""mining"" for
them with almost no support (and thus almost no obvious limitation :-))
for their efforts.  The one, single, thing in the gospels which Jesus
specifically ""gives"" as ""a commandment"" to us is ""love one another.""

	[I will be expanding on this point in a reply to Paul Hudson
	 that I hope to get to in a day or so -- it is quite true that
	 SOME Christians infer LOTS of commandments from the NT; I'll
	 point out what has to be going on in these inferences, and why
	 there is a huge amount of ""cultural baggage"" involved.]

You are quite right that this is ""goo"" if one is looking for an ethical
system.

But why should anyone BE looking for an ethical system, since our
society is eager to hand us one or more no matter what we do?  It
may be that we need a principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems
-- in which case I will profer the _agapate allelou_ once again.


I think you are begging the question. Why don't I and the (myriads
of) other Christians like me tell you something about Christianity?
[Nor is this very new in Christianity -- you might want to look up
the origins and fundamental doctrines of the Quakers, from the 17th
century onwards, and they are not at all the first to understand the
gospel in a manner that is congenial to my case.]",religion

I would hardly consider the BD's to be Christian.  They were acting in
direct contradiction to scripture.  Jesus' Second Coming is something
that everyone will know of.  Jesus also predicted that there will be
false Messiahs who will use His name.  His prophecy has been fulfilled.


I agree with you there.
 

Me too.  I have already given my life to God.  If God tells me to lay
down my life, it will be to save another life.
 

Do you judge all Christians by the acts of those who would call
themselves Christian and yet are not?  The BD's contradicted scripture
in their actions.  They were NOT Christian.  Simple as that.  Perhaps
you have read too much into what the media has portrayed.  Ask any
true-believing Christian and you will find that they will deny any
association with the BD's.  Even the 7th Day Adventists have denied any
further ties with this cult, which was what they were.

Do you judge all Muslims by the acts committed by Saddam Hussein, a 
supposedly devout Muslim?  I don't.  Saddam is just a dictator using

Well the attorneys of the Davidians reported on Larry King that
the tanks had actually damaged the structure to the extent that
effectuating egress from the building was difficult at best.
With a rapidly spreading fire and large amounts of smoke and
tear gas, finding the right exits, or acceptible holes in the walls
were nearly impossible.  I find this explanation to be completely 
plausible.  Doesn't mean that it's true, but I don't find it
intrinsically less believable than the government stories.



I concur.


Indeed.  According to the lawyers, the Davidian survivors say that
lanterns were knocked over during the ""probing"" and that's how
the fire started.  A tragic accident, if true.



See above.  This one is going to be thoroughly investigated.  Maybe
we'll eventually get some idea of what happened.  My view is that,
from beginning to end, this operation was a botch and that it is
completely possible that nut cases who were otherwise law-abiding
citizens were victims of a bureaucratic execution.

     TRIAD, the first drag-free satellite, was designed and built by the 
Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory and launched 2 Sept 1972.  The 
satellite was in three sections separated by two booms.  The central section 
housed the DISCOS Disturbance Compensation System, which consisted of a proof 
mass of special non-magnetic alloy housed within a spherical cavity.  The 
proof mass flew a true gravitational orbit, free from drag and radiation 
pressure.  Teflon microthrusters kept the body of the satellite centered 
around the proof mass, thereby flying the entire satellite drag free.

     TRIAD was one of the APL-designed Navy Navigation Satellites.  The 
2nd-generation operational navigation satellites flying today (NOVA) use a 
single-axis version of DISCOS.  TRIAD was also the sixth APL satellite to be 
powered by an RTG (APL flew the first nuclear power supply in space, in 1961).

"

	This is the crux of the argument (to me at least).  Both the
SDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's
defense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  You can talk about how
important calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls
in the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various
catcher's rank in ""defense"".  

	Looking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect
that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves
(or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as I
can tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics
(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking
the ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to
clear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitions
at AAA are any better then reps in the majors!  

	All we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and
Berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping
the pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost
all veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn
the major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to
learn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn't
be supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over
pitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But 
given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.

	Now, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league
pitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring
problem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he
can't learn just as well while in the majors?  ",sport

"

But whatever the neutrons hit has a good chance of absorbing the
neutron and becoming radioactive itself. Mostly, that means water
turning into (harmless) heavy water. But some neutrons would 
also hit bones, and the resulting harmfull, secondard radioactives
would remain in the body for decades. I think an unshielded nuclear
warhead could reasonably be considered a public health hazard.

As for a shielded warhead, I think a fair amount of maintaince
is required for it to remain safely shielded (e.g. storage in
a dry, temperature-regulated facility, etc...) For private
ownership to be unregulated, I think a single individual must
be able not only to keep the weapon, but keep it in a safe
condition. If any random private citizen could not properly
keep, maintain and store a nuclear weapon, then some regulation
is clearly appropriate.



I disagree with this purpose: The job of the militia is to defend
themselves and their community. If you look at the American 
revolution as an example, the militias won by seperating themselves
from, and becoming independent of, a repressive government. They
didn't overthrow it, and those communities (Canada and England, for 
example) that didn't defend themselves were still under that same
old regime. If the role of the militia were offensive, to go out and
destroy repressive governments, nuclear weapons _might_ be appropriate.
But their jobs is defensive, and nuclear weapons aren't suited
for that.

There is also the question of personal and collective arms: The
Second Amendment definately protects ownership of personal
weapons (since the very nature of the militia requires members
to provide their own arms.) But it isn't clear if it covers
other arms. Certainly, not all members would supply (for example)
a tank, only a few could or (if they were to be used effectively)
should. However, those providing the heavy weapons have a 
disproportionate control over the militia and its fierpower.
The militias, as the framers envisioned them, were extremely
democratic: If only 50% of the members supported the cause, only
50% would respond to a muster, and the militia's firepower would
be proportionately reduced. Militia firepower and the popular
will were, therefore, linked. But if a small minority of the
members supplied a large fraction of the firepower (in the
form of heavy weapons) this would all change: The militia's
firepower would depend on the will of a small minority, not
of the general public. Worse, that minority would be quite
different from the general public (at the very least, they
would be much richer.) As a result, I think the nature and
character of the militia requires that each member provide
a roughly equal share of the militia's firepower: His personal
weapons, and some equitable fraction of a squad's heavier firepower.",politics

homosexuality from it's list of mental illnesses, it is also no mistake that
there are many Christians and homophobes who long to bring it back to the list.
I do not feel threatened by gays, I don't understand why others are.

The following is an article concerning two of the more popular ex-gay min-
istries:  Exodus International & Homosexuals Anonymous.

THE FOUNDER OF AN ""EX-GAY"" SUPPORT GROUP CHOOSES HOMO OVER HETERO

by Robert Pela (from Gay oriented magazine ADVOCATE)

In December 1985, David Caligiuri received one of The Advocate's homophobia rewaa
awards: the A Prayer A Day Keeps the Lust Away citation.  As director of FREE
INDEED, a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri was singled out for offering
discontented gays and lesbians ""a way out of the homosexual death-style""
through prayer.  ""I'd like to give the award back,"" Caligiuri now laughs, ""I'm
no longer deserve it.""
  Caligiuri's eight year involvement with the national ""ex-gay"" movement peaked
with his founding of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexuals Anonymous (HA) as well
as Free Indeed.  He has since abandoned his pulpit and now says that the ex-
gay movement is a fruitless effort based on deception.  ""There's no reality
in it,"" he says, ""I was selling a product, and my product was a lie.""
  Headed up by national ministries like Exodus International and Courage, the
organizations of the ex-gay movement rely on the tenents of born-again
Christianity to convince disatisfied homosexuals -- usually young gay men who
are just coming out -- that they can shed their sexuality by suppressing their
sexual urges and embracing Christianity.  ""We offer support to people who are
seeking to leave the sin of homosexuality,"" explains Bob Davies, director of
Exodus.  He ventures that ""about 80% of those seeking to abandon their homo-
sexuality are men.""
  ""Anybody who is involved in the ex-gay ministry is misguided and is wasting
their time,"" says Lisa Seeley, a former ""redeemed lesbian"" who worked with
Caligiuri as HA and appeared with him on the Sally Jessy Raphael show.  ""These
organizations are for people who are spiritually and emotionally wounded.""
  ""It's possible to change your identity or your behavior,"" says sex educator
Brian McNaught, author of _On Being Gay_. ""But it's really impossible to
change your orientation.  These people are no longer calling themselves gay,
but they continue to have same-sex erotic feelings.""
  Caligiuri says he founded Free Indeed after an ominous week in 1981 when all
hell broke loose in his personal life.  A few days after his lover ended both
their romance and their business partnership, Caligiuri was sexually assaulted
by a man he picked up in a bar.  ""I was really drunk,"" he recalls, ""and I
went home with this guy.  He tied me up and raped me.  He left me tied up all
night, and the next morning he raped me again.""
  When Caligiuri was eventually freed by the attacker, he returned home to the
home he shared with his ex-lover.  ""He had another man there with him,""
Caligiuri recalls.  ""I thought at this time, 'If this is what being gay is
about, I don't want to be this way anymore.""
  Caligiuri vowed that if he could find a way out, he would share his discovery
with others.  He organized an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix's
gay pride parade in June 1985, and a few months later Free Indeed held its
first public protest.  At a meeting to promote a gay civil rights ordinance,
Free Indeed members loudly blasted gays, telling them ther were sinners headed
for hell.
  Free Indeed began receiving about a hundred telephone calls a week, thanks
in part to a deceptive listing in the local yellow pages.  ""We were listed
under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Services,"" Caligiuri says, ""so people
thought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out
where the local bars were, and we'd preach to them about the sins of homo-
sexuality.""  Ruses like this are typical of the movement, Caligiuri says,
adding, ""They'll do anything to reach these people.""
  ""David used to go on radio and say really stupid things,"" recalls Peter
Kelly, a counselor at Phoenix's Catholic diocese AIDS program, ""like that
he knew he was gay when he started wearing pastel colors.""
  Caligiuri's family first found out about his ministry when they saw him on
Raphael's syndicated talk show in 1985.  ""They were relieved,"" he recalls.
""They figured that if they had to have a gay person in the family, better
that I should be a 'reformed' gay person.""
  But Caligiuri was hardly reformed.  ""By the time I appeared on Sally's
show,"" ""I'd started having sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline
and tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their
father.  I was horny all the time.""
  Unable to risk going to gay bars, where he might be recognized from his
numerous television appearances, Caligiuri says he ""used to go to bookstores
and get blowjobs.""  When he wasn't working the bookstores, he was sleeping
with other ""reformed"" homosexuals.
  ""I didn't realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leaders were having sex
with one another,"" Caligiuri says.  ""We'd go to conferences in other cities,
and we'd be paired up in hotel rooms.  Everybody was sleeping with everybody
else.""
  By the time he appeared on 'AM Philadelphia' television show in May 1988,
Caligiuri was having anonymous sex a couple times a week.  When the show's
host asked him if he ever ""acted on temptation,"" his answer was a lie.
  Caligiuri's duplicity began to take it's toll on him, however.  He was
suffering from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasis, a dibilitating
yeast infection, and this led to his escape from the sect.  ""I was too sick
to go to church,"" he explains.  ""The more time I spent away from those people
the more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I used to be.""
  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turned Free Indeed phone lines over to a local
church and closed the ministry's doors.  ""I'd convinced myself that there
is no need in the world for ex-gay people,"" he says.
  Today, Caligiuri, 31, is studying alternative spiritualities (""I'm interest-
ed in belief systems that aren't judgemental.""), considering romance (""But
not with a CHristian!""), and searching for a new project to devote himself to.
""I feel compelled to commit myself to gay causes,"" he says.  ""I want to
eventually stop feeling guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I
may have brought to our community.""

---end article---

Caligiuri's tory is by no means unique and I have read several other articles
of former leaders and founders of 'ex-gay' ministries who have said very similar th
similar things.  Fortuantely not all of them have left Christianity, but have
come to realize that God loves them despite the attitudes of others.  Some,
like Chris Glaser, director of the Presbyterian ""Lazarus Project"" of West
Hollywood Presbyterian Church have actually been working with the gay community
to bring them into the sheepfold of Christ and encouraging real ethical values
of sexuality within the sphere of being gay.  I have also, as I said talked and become
and become close friends with many who once attended such groups as ""Love In
Action"" and others, who either once claimed to have been ""reformed"" or who
were too honest with themselves to live a lie, no matter who was disappointed
in them.  Some were even encouraged to marry as a way of ""sealing"" their
new heterosexuality, only to eventually start hitting the bars, bathhouses
and bookstores, since these were usually activities under the concealment of
night and one-night-stands of promiscuous behavior meant no continuous ""sin""
through a committed relationship.  This is a horrible trap which the CHurch
has dumped on the backs of the truly gay oriented people, and the very inno-
cent victims in these cases are the wives and children of such marriages.  Yet
the church insists that there are only two options they are willing to allow
gay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  This is sad.  What is also
mrtifying, is in the cases of those who cannot suppress their desires and
fear for thier sanity in such a mixed up confusion that the church forces on
them, they may even opt for 'suicide' or surgical dampering of the brain
functions.  In the past lobotomies and heavey drug suppressants were common-
place.  There are now becoming available more and more literature on the
threat of coercive Christianity toward gays, such as Sylvia Pennington's
_""Ex-Gays?  There Are None_. and others.  There are also a great many fact
based books being written to help people trapped in this confusion such as
Maury Johnston's _Gays Under Grace_, and Chris Glaser's _Come Hom!_.  I
seriously recommend those for people seeking help for this persecution and
self-acceptance.",religion

Flight Sequence C8 is active, the Spacecraft subsystems and instrument
payload performing well in Array Normal Spin and outer cruise
configuration, with uplink and downlink via the High Gain Antenna; uplink
at 125 bps, downlink at the 2 K Engineering data rate.

As a result of the spacecraft entering Contingency Mode on April 9, all
payload instruments were automatically powered off by on-board fault
protection software.  Gamma Ray Spectrometer Random Access Memory
was successfully reloaded on Monday, April 19.  To prepare for
Magnetometer Calibrations which were rescheduled for execution in Flight
Sequence C9 on Tuesday and Wednesday of next week, a reload of Payload
Data System Random Access Memory will take place this morning
beginning at 10:30 AM.

Over this weekend, the Flight Team will send real-time commands to
perform Differential One-Way Ranging to obtain additional data for
analysis by the Navigation Team.  Radio Science Ultra Stable Oscillator
testing will take place on Monday .

The Flight Sequence C9 uplink will occur on Sunday, April 25, with
activation at Midnight, Monday evening April 26.  C9 has been modified to
include Magnetometer Calibrations which could not be performed in C8 due
to Contingency Mode entry on April 9.  These Magnetometer instrument
calibrations will allow the instrument team to better characterize the
spacecraft-generated magnetic field and its effect on their instrument.
This information is critical to Martian magnetic field measurements
which occur during approach and mapping phases. MAG Cals will require
the sequence to command the spacecraft out of Array Normal Spin state
and perform slew and roll maneuvers to provide the MAG team data points

/Why is making someone a less productive member of society immoral?

Hudson, you are screwing up again.  Morality does not (I say again, DOES
NOT) define only ""right and wrong"".  It also defines ""acceptable social
behavior"", without any overtones of good and evil.  Picking up your trash
is not really a right/wrong moral issue in the eternal sense of Good
and Evil.  Yet it is moral in the sense that it is acceptable social
behavior"".  

Your definition of the word ""morality"" is what is causing you to trip over 
yourself here.

/Why is your benefit somehow related to morality.

Again, your definition is causing you to shoot yourself in the foot.





/(hudson)
/What about if someone feels that their own personal benefit is enhanced
/more than it would be damaged by depleting the overall resources of society?
/Maybe something might hurt society, but it would help him immensly?

That is irrational thinking.  

There may also be people out there who think that death by atomic 
destruction is  a sublime and wonderful thing. I am not going to let them
execute that idea just because they want to do it. 

Simply because I let people make up their minds about what morals they
have doesn't prevent me from spotting and stopping a madman when I see
one, Hudson.  And even then, I will only stop him when he interferes 
with me and my life.  That is the difference between me and you:  you
want to interfere in people's lives even when they aren't affecting
you.  





/(hudson)
/The central character in Dostoevsky's novel, Crime and Punishment, 
/(R something or other) reasoned that if killed this old Jewish woman and
/stole her money to educate and establish himself financially, he could
/make a great contribution to society.  He reasoned that she was not of 
/much profit to society.  She just collected rents, and hoarded money.


One of the central points of any (that's ANY) moral system is that is
has to be internally consistent.  

By killing her, the character had to accept the premise that the ends
justify the means.  If he accepted that premise, then (in order to be
consistent), he must accept the idea that some day another person may
apply the same standard to HIS life.  Now, if he is unwilling to accept
this premise (which he will not be willing to accept), then he has
behaved inconsistently with his own moral standard.

I certainly do use it whenever I have to do TIFF, and it usually works
very well.  That's not my point.  I'm >philosophically< opposed to it
because of its complexity.

This complexity has led to some programs' poor TIFF writers making
some very bizarre files, other programs' inability to load TIFF
images (though they'll save them, of course), and a general
inability to interchange images between different environments
despite the fact they all think they understand TIFF.

As the saying goes, ""It's not me I'm worried about- it's all the
abuse of TIFF over the years, and I chalk it all up to the immense (and
unnecessary) complexity of the format.

In the words of the TIFF 5.0 spec, Appendix G, page G-1 (capitalized
emphasis mine):

""The only problem with this sort of success is that TIFF was designed
to be powerful and flexible, at the expense of simplicity.  It takes a
fair amount of effort to handle all the options currently defined in
this specification (PROBABLY NO APPLICATION DOES A COMPLETE JOB),
and that is currently the only way you can be >sure< that you will be
able to import any TIFF image, since there are so many
image-generating applications out there now.""


If a program (or worse all applications) can't read >every< TIFF
image, that means there are some it won't- some that I might have to
deal with.  Why would I want my images to be trapped in that format?  I
don't and neither should anyone who agrees with my reasoning- not
that anyone does, of course! :-)",graphics

And I maintain:

Some people do not want to enter into the light and the knowledge that
they alone are their own masters, because they fear it; they are too
afraid of having to face the world on their own terms.  And so, by
their own choice, they will remain in darkness, sort of like bugs
under a rock.  However, some people, but not many, will not like the
darkness.  Sometimes it gets too cold and too dark to be comfortable.
These people will crawl out from under the rock, and, although blinded
at first, will get accustomed to the light and enjoy its warmth.  And,
after a while, now that they can see things for what they really are,
they will also see the heights which they can reach, and the places
they can go, and they will learn to choose their own paths through the
world, and they will learn from their mistakes and revel in their
successes.

They will see that there is much much more to the world than just the
narrow experiences under the rock.  They will discover that life under
a rock was incredibly yucky, and that life on their own terms is great
-- so great that they will want to tell everyone else about it.

Do you see my point?  I think you're the one under the rock, and I'm
getting a great tan out here in the sunlight.  My life has improved
immesurably since I abandoned theism -- come and join me!  It will be
a difficult trip at first, until you build up your muscles for the
long hike, but it's well worth it!


Look, you just practically equated Odin and Zeus?  They're as much
different as your god is from them...

Don't you see?  I'm not going to accept ANYTHING that I can't witness
with my own eyes or experience with my own senses, especially not
something as mega-powerful as what you're trying to get me to accept.
Surely if you believe in it this strongly, you must have a good
*reason* to, don't you?


When did I say that?  I say that I would rather CEASE EXISTING instead
of being subject to the whims of a deity, but that if the deity
decided to toss me into the fiery pits because of who I am, then so be it.


Nope -- most people are Christian.  Most people are fond of feeling
that they are imperfect, of believing that the world is an undesirable
place, of reciting magical mystical prayers to make the world nice and
holy again, of doing just as their priests tell them, like good little
sheep.  You enjoy darkness, and you're proud of it.

You may know the Bible well -- but have you read any of the Koran?  Or
Zen writings?  Or Hare Krishna literature?  If you haven't, then how
can you say you have an open mind?


Nope.  You make decisions, enjoy your successes, and accept your
failures; then you die.  If you are content with the life you've led
as you reflect back on it in your final moments, then you've led a
good life.


Please do.


I'm sorry, I don't feel that sacrificing Jesus was something any god
I'd worship would do, unless the sacrifice was only temporary, in
which case it's not really all that important.

Subject: 3d GrafSys 1.21 in incoming directory
A 3d GrafSys short description follows:

Programmers 3D GrafSys Vers 1.21 now available. 

Version 1.21 is mainly a bugfix for THINK C users. THIS VERSION
NOW RUNS WITH THINK C, I PROMISE! The Docs now contain a chapter for
C programmers on how to use the GrafSys. If you have problems, feel free 
to contact me.
The other change is that I removed the FastPerfTrig calls from
the FPU version to make it run faster.

Those of you who don't know what all this is about, read on.

********

Programmers 3D GrafSys -- What it is:
-------------------------------------

Didn't you always have this great game in mind where you needed some way of 
drawing three-dimensional scenes? 

Didn't you always want to write this program that visualized the structure 
of three-dimensional molecules?

And didn't the task of writing your 3D conversions routines keep you from 
actually doing it?

Well if the answer to any of the above questions is 'Yes, but what has it to 
do with this package???' , read on.

GrafSys is a THINK Pascal/C library that provides you with simple routines 
for building, saving, loading (as resources), and manipulating 
(independent rotating around arbitrary achses, translating and scaling) 
three dimensional objects. Objects, not just simple single-line drawings.

GrafSys supports full 3D clipping, animation and some (primitive) hidden-
line/hidden-surface drawing with simple commands from within YOUR PROGRAM.

GrafSys also supports full eye control with both perspective and parallel
projections (If you can't understand a word, don't worry, this is just showing
off for those who know about it. The docs that come with it will try to explain
what it all means later on). 

GrafSys provides a powerful interface to supply your own drawing routines with
data so you can use GrafSys to do the 3D transformations and your own routines
to do the actual drawing. (Note that GrafSys also provides drawing routines so
you don't have to worry about that if you don't want to)

GrafSys 1.11 comes in two versions. One for the 881 and 020 or above 
processors. The other version uses fixed-point arithmetic and runs on any Mac.
Both versions are *100% source compatibel*. 

GrafSys comes with an extensive manual that teaches you the fundamentals of 3D
graphics and how to use the package.

If demand is big enough I will convert the GrafSys to an object-class library. 
However, I feelt that the way it is implemented now makes it easier to use for
a lot more people than the select 'OOP-Guild'.

GrafSys is free for any non-commercial usage. Read the documentation enclosed.

Andy-- I think we do agree, given your clarification of how we were 
each using the terms fact and theory.  I'll only add that I
think perhaps I feel more strongly about separating them,
though your usage is quite valid.


I'll add here that any falsification or rejection does not in any way
reduce its current usefulness.  So long as it accurately predicts or 
describes things we can observe.

Not to be a pain in the ass, but is there any reason you don't
just say _the theory of evolution_ rather than the _fact of evolution
is still a theory_.  I'm asking because this whole thread got started
because I was bothered by a post that referred to _the fact of evolution_,
basically leaving off the phrase _is still a theory_.  Without a 
clarification, like the one you just gave, just saying _the fact of
evolution_ has a very different meaning to me.

I'm not sure I agree here.  Again, it may be because I feel stronger
about separating terms.  I was trying to say that the _theories_
proposed to explain the _mechanisms_ and the _mechanisms_ themselves
are the only realities here.  It is the existence of mechanisms, not 
the things themselves, that are so predictive as to be considered 
fact (as you would say).  There aren't really little planetary particle 
systems called atoms out there.  Or I should say, and more to my original 
point, it would be a leap of faith to say there are, because we observe only 
the mechanisms.  There is no need to _believe_ there are _actually_
atoms out there as we have decided to think about them.  It's enough
to discuss the mechanisms.  At any rate, I'm not sure I am being 
any clearer than before, but I thought it was worth a shot.

The bottom line, though, is I think we agree on two fundamental ideas:

   1. --evolution is a theory supported by observational evidence (my way)
      --the fact of evolution is a theory supported by observational
        evidence (your way)

   2. --creation is just an opinion.  If a theist wants to call it
        a theory then he can.  I won't:  it has no supporting evidence 
	and it neither predicts nor supports any observations that can
        be made.  With no mechanisms to talk about, there really isn't
	much to say.

Do you agree?

Well, if you're going to get upset with this, you might as well direct
some of this moral outrage towards Glavcosmos as well.  They pioneered
this capitalist application of booster adverts long before NASA.
(Sign of the times: a Sony logo on a Soyuz launcher...)


This sounds like something Lowell Wood would think of.  Does anyone
know if he's involved?


This may be the purpose for the University of Colorado people.  My
guess is that the purpose for the Livermore people is to learn how to
build large, inflatable space structures.


If this is true, I think it's a great idea.

Learning how to build to build structures in space in an essential
step towards space development, and given that Freedom appears to be
shrinking towards the vanishing point, I question whether NASA's space
station is going to provide much, if any, knowledge in this area.
(Especially if a design such as Faget's wingless orbiter is chosen...)
If such a project also monitors ozone depletion and demonstrates
creative use of (partial) private sector funding in the process -- so
much the better.


And does anyone have any more details other than what was in the WN
news blip?  How serious is this project?  Is this just in the ""wild
idea"" stage or does it have real funding?


Not yet.  Though, if this project goes through, I suppose The Return

For the purpose of a contest, I'd bet some things could be cut.  Like fuel
for re-entry, any kind of heat shielding, etc., etc.  Even still, if the
contest participants had to fund DC-1 development, it probably wouldn't be
worth it to develop DC-1 (just for the contest).  Just give me the cheapest
heaviest lift man rated (or at least under 6 or so Gs) booster...  If I
don't have to pay for DC-1 development, great!, I'll use it.

But back to the contest goals, there was a recent article in AW&ST about a
low cost (it's all relative...) manned return to the moon.  A General
Dynamics scheme involving a Titan IV & Shuttle to lift a Centaur upper
stage, LEV, and crew capsule.  The mission consists of delivering two
unmanned payloads to the lunar surface, followed by a manned mission. 
Total cost:  US was $10-$13 billion.  Joint ESA(?)/NASA project was $6-$9
billion for the US share.

I didn't find a mention of how long the crew could stay, but I'd bet that
its  around 30 days.  And the total payload delivered was about 30 metric
tonnes.  So if you ignore the scientific payload, hitch a ride in the crew
habitation module (no return trip...), and toss in a few more tonnes for
the additional consumables to last another 11 months, then you *might* be
able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes (and in case its not obvious,
that's a wild ass guess).  A pretty boring visit, since every trip outdoors
eats up a bit of LOX.  And I'm not certain if a home brewed (or
college-brewed) life support system could last a year.  But let's round
this up to 19.4 tonnes (convient, since the GD plan talks about 9.7 ton
payloads delivered to the lunar surface.  This adds up to two Centaurs, two
LEVs, two Shuttle flights... All to put a single man on the moon for a
year.   Hmmm.  Not really practical.  Anyone got a cheaper/better way of
delivering 15-20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade?  Anyone
have a more precise guess about how much a year's supply of consumables and
equipment would weigh?

And I was wondering about the GD LEV.  Is it reusable?  Or is it discarded
to burn up on return to LEO?  If its not discarded, could it be refueled? 
Henry: Do you know anything about the GD LEV?  I noted that it uses RL-10
engines.  Aren't they reusable/restartable?  Would a LEV fit in a DC-1? 
I've forgotten (if I ever knew) what the cargo bay dimensions are for the
DC-1.

All in all, I'm not certain that the single goal/prize of staying on the
moon for a year is wise and/or useful.  How about:  A prize for the first
non-government sponsered unmanned moon landing, then another for a manned
moon landing, then yet another for a system to extract consumables from
lunar soil, another for a reusable earth/moon shuttle, and so forth.  Find
some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure...  Having a single goal
might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared
to win.  And for those that didn't give up, I find something a little scary
about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters.  I'd
like to see as much a reward for co-operation as for competition.

Lastly, about ten or fifteen years back I seem to recall that there was an
English space magazine that had an on-going discussion about moonbases on
the cheap.  I recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human
body produced, how much lunar material it'd need for protection from solar
flares, etc.  Unfortunately I don't remember the name of this magazine.

I was assuming that there won't be a moon base unless it makes a
profit, actually.  If it does, well, that gives a larger GNP which
leads to being able to spend more money on your military, including
gosh-wow space stuff.  (assuming it's profitable, rather than paying
for itself.)

You might be able to _run_ one for that; put it there, hardly.

     The Giants always hit Maddux well, but it was interesting that Maddux
did not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night.  He threw 2 straight
fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the
first one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd,
when Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally
walk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.

     The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has
not scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning
about his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he
has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.



     The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.  Burba
has done a superb job filling in so far, he looks like a different pitcher
from last year.  However, Swift is terrible in both of his starts.  With
Burba moving into the rotation, Mike Jackson is the only right-handed
reliever aside from Rod Beck, he'll get a lot of actions.  I also hope that
Dusty can manage his bullpen better than Roger Craig, especially on Beck.
I was concerned when Beck was used for 3 straight days earlier this week.

Reasons: programs that I've seen are far too slow for this purpose.

Platform: 386/486 class machine.
	  800x600-16 or 1024x728-16 VGA graphics
		(speed is important, 16-color for non-rendering
		 purpose is enough; may stay at 800x600 for
		 speed reason.)
         (hope the code would be generic enough for different SVGA
          cards.  My own card is based on Trident 8900c, not VESA?)

What I'm looking for?
1) fast, very fast routines to draw lines/circles/simple-shapes
   on above-mentioned SVGA resolutions.
   Presumably in assembly languagine.
	Yes, VERY FAST please.
2) related codes to help rotating/zooming/animating the drawings on screen.
   Drawings for beginning, would be lines, circles mainly, think of
   text, else later.
   (you know, the way molecular graphics rotates, zooms a molecule)
2) and any other codes (preferentially in C) that can help the 
   project.

"A very kind soul has mailed me this reply for the bugs in CView.
Since he isn't in the position to post this himself, he asked me to post
it for him, but to leave his name out. So here it comes:

CView has quite a number of bugs.  The one you mention is perhaps the most
annoying, but not the most dangerous.  As far as I can determine, it has to
do with the temp files that CView creates.  CView gives the user no control
over where it places its temp files: it just places them in its
""current directory"".  The problem you mention occurs (as far as I can tell)
when it runs out of disk space for its temp files. It seems as if CView
doesn't check properly for this situation.  As Cview decodes a jpeg, it seems 
to write out a temp file with all the pixel data with 24 bit colour
information. Then, for 8 bit displays, it does the ""dithering"", again writing
another file with the 8 bit colour information.  While it is writing this
second file, it also writes the data to your colour card. Then when it does
the last chunk of 8 bit data, it recopies all the data from the 8 bit file to
your screen again.  (It does this last ""recopy"" operation for its
""fit to screen"" feature, even when this feature is not enabled.)

 The result of this process is the following:
  
     1) If it runs out of disk space when writing the first 24 bit file, all
        you ever see is as much data as it has room for, and the last bit of
        data is simply repeated over and over again because CView never
        realizes the disk has filled up and disk writes/reads aren't performed.

     2) If it has enough room for the 24 bit data, but runs out of room for
        the 8 bit data, you see almost all of the picture as it does the
        dithering and writes to the screen card.
        However, then when it finishes the dithering and recopies the data
        from the 8 bit file to screen (for whatever reason it does this)
        one again just gets a repetition of the last chunk of data for which
        there was room on the disk.

This is just a guess, but probably fairly accurate.  At least the general
idea is on track I think, although I have probably made errors in details
about file I/O etc.  The way around this is  of course to clear up sufficient
disk space.  The temp files for large JPEG's (1200x900 and bigger) can be
very large (3 Meg + 1 Meg ).  On some of the largest I have needed in excess
of 6 Meg free disk space.


CView has a much more serious bug: if you are trying to display a file from
a floppy, and you change floppies while CView has some temp file open on the
floppy, then CView in certain circumstances will write the directory (and FAT
table? I can't remember) for the removed floppy onto the newly inserted
floppy, thus corruptimg the new floppy in a very serious, possibly
unrevcoverable way.  SO BE CAREFUL!  It is incredibly poor programming for a
program to do this.  On the other hand, when choosing files in the Open Files
menu, CView insists on doing a few disk reads every time one moves the
hi-lighter square.  Incredibly annoying when it could do them all at once
when it gets the directory info.  And really, how much effort does it take to
sort a directory listing?

   Sean, the 68070 exists! :-)



   Sean, I don't want to get into a 'mini-war' by what I am going to say,
but I have to be a little bit skeptic about the performance you are
claiming on the Centris, you'll see why (please, no-flames, I reserve
those for c.s.m.a :-) )

   I was in Chicago in the last consumer electronics show, and Apple had a
booth there.  I walked by, and they were showing real-time video capture
using a (Radious or SuperMac?) card to digitize and make right on the spot
quicktime movies.  I think the quicktime they were using was the old one
(1.5).

   They digitized a guy talking there in 160x2xx something.  It played back quite
nicely and in real time.  The guy then expanded the window (resized) to 25x by
3xx (320 in y I think) and the frame rate decreased enough to notice that it
wasn't 30fps (or about 30fps) anymore.  It dropped to like 15 fps.  Then he
increased it just a bit more, and it dropped to 10<->12 fps. 

   Then I asked him what Mac he was using... He was using a Quadra (don't know
what model, 900?) to do it, and he was telling the guys there that the Quicktime
could play back at the same speed even on an LCII.

   Well, I spoiled his claim so to say, since a 68040 Quadra Mac was having
a little bit of trouble.  And this wasn't even from the hardisk!  This was
from memory!

   Could it be that you saw either a newer version of quicktime, or some
hardware assisted Centris, or another software product running the 
animation (like supposedly MacroMind's Accelerator?)?

   Don't misunderstand me, I just want to clarify this.

   But for the sake of the posting about a computer doing it or not, I can
claim 320x200 (a tad more with overscan) being done in 256,000+ colors in 
my computer (not from the hardisk) at 30fps with Scala MM210.

   But I agree, if we consider MPEG stuff, I think a multimedia consumer
low-priced box has a lot of market... I just think 3DO would make it, 
no longer CD-I.

    WHAT HAPPENED TO THE SATURN V PLANS

    Despite a widespread belief to the contrary, the Saturn V blueprints
    have not been lost. They are kept at Marshall Space Flight Center on
    microfilm.

    The problem in re-creating the Saturn V is not finding the drawings, it
    is finding vendors who can supply mid-1960's vintage hardware (like
    guidance system components), and the fact that the launch pads and VAB
    have been converted to Space Shuttle use, so you have no place to launch
    from.

    By the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re-modify
    the launch pads, you may as well have started from scratch with a clean
    sheet design.


    WHY DATA FROM SPACE MISSIONS ISN'T IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE

    Investigators associated with NASA missions are allowed exclusive access
    for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an
    opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being
    ""scooped"" by people uninvolved in the mission. However, NASA frequently
    releases examples (in non-digital form, e.g. photos) to the public early
    in a mission.


    RISKS OF NUCLEAR (RTG) POWER SOURCES FOR SPACE PROBES

    There has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to
    block the Galileo and Ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium
    thermal sources being dangerous. Numerous studies claim that even in
    worst-case scenarios (shuttle explosion during launch, or accidental
    reentry at interplanetary velocities), the risks are extremely small.
    Two interesting data points are (1) The May 1968 loss of two SNAP 19B2
    RTGs, which landed intact in the Pacific Ocean after a Nimbus B weather
    satellite failed to reach orbit. The fuel was recovered after 5 months
    with no release of plutonium. (2) In April 1970, the Apollo 13 lunar
    module reentered the atmosphere and its SNAP 27 RTG heat source, which
    was jettisoned, fell intact into the 20,000 feet deep Tonga Trench in
    the Pacific Ocean. The corrosion resistant materials of the RTG are
    expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10
    half-lives of the Pu-238 fuel or about 870 years [DOE 1980].

    IMPACT OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE ON THE OZONE LAYER

    From time to time, claims are made that chemicals released from
    the Space Shuttle's Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) are responsible
    for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer. Studies
    indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact, both in
    absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources. The
    remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted
    study, Charles Jackman.

    The atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the
    stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups, and was
    organized by Dr. Michael Prather, NASA/Goddard Institute for Space
    Studies.  The three groups involved Michael Prather and Maria Garcia
    (NASA/GISS), Charlie Jackman and Anne Douglass (NASA/Goddard Space
    Flight Center), and Malcolm Ko and Dak Sze (Atmospheric and
    Environmental Research, Inc.).  The effort was to look at the effects
    of the space shuttle and Titan rockets on the stratosphere.

    The following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine:

       Industrial sources:    300,000,000 kilograms/year
	  Natural sources:     75,000,000 kilograms/year
	  Shuttle sources:	  725,000 kilograms/year

    The shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 Titan rockets are
    launched yearly. Thus the launches would add less than 0.25% to the
    total stratospheric chlorine sources.

    The effect on ozone is minimal:  global yearly average total ozone would
    be decreased by 0.0065%. This is much less than total ozone variability
    associated with volcanic activity and solar flares.

    The influence of human-made chlorine products on ozone is computed
    by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1% decrease in globally
    averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990. The influence of the space shuttle and
    Titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible.  The launch
    schedule of the Space Shuttle and Titan rockets would need to be
    increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about
    the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons
    do at the present time.

    Theoretical results of this study have been published in _The Space
    Shuttle's Impact on the Stratosphere_, MJ Prather, MM Garcia, AR
    Douglass, CH Jackman, M.K.W. Ko and N.D. Sze, Journal of Geophysical

    HOW LONG CAN A HUMAN LIVE UNPROTECTED IN SPACE

    If you *don't* try to hold your breath, exposure to space for half a
    minute or so is unlikely to produce permanent injury. Holding your
    breath is likely to damage your lungs, something scuba divers have to
    watch out for when ascending, and you'll have eardrum trouble if your
    Eustachian tubes are badly plugged up, but theory predicts -- and animal
    experiments confirm -- that otherwise, exposure to vacuum causes no
    immediate injury. You do not explode. Your blood does not boil. You do
    not freeze. You do not instantly lose consciousness.

    Various minor problems (sunburn, possibly ""the bends"", certainly some
    [mild, reversible, painless] swelling of skin and underlying tissue)
    start after ten seconds or so. At some point you lose consciousness from
    lack of oxygen. Injuries accumulate. After perhaps one or two minutes,
    you're dying. The limits are not really known.

    HOW THE CHALLENGER ASTRONAUTS DIED

    The Challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion. This is
    a well-documented fact; see the Rogers Commission report, for example.
    What looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank
    came apart. The forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the
    astronauts, never mind destroy their bodies, according to the Kerwin
    team's medical/forensic report.

    The astronauts were killed when the more-or-less intact cabin hit the
    water at circa 200MPH, and their bodies then spent several weeks
    underwater. Their remains were recovered, and after the Kerwin team
    examined them, they were sent off to be buried.


    USING THE SHUTTLE BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT

    You can't use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low Earth orbit
    because it can't get there. It is big and heavy and does not carry
    enough fuel, even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks.

    Furthermore, it is not particularly sensible to do so, because much of
    that weight is things like wings, which are totally useless except in
    the immediate vicinity of the Earth. The shuttle orbiter is highly
    specialized for travel between Earth's surface and low orbit. Taking it
    higher is enormously costly and wasteful. A much better approach would
    be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high-orbit
    spacecraft.

    [Yet another concise answer by Henry Spencer.]


    THE ""FACE ON MARS""

    There really is a big rock on Mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid
    face. It appears in two different frames of Viking Orbiter imagery:
    35A72 (much more facelike in appearance, and the one more often
    published, with the Sun 10 degrees above western horizon) and 70A13
    (with the Sun 27 degrees from the west).

    Science writer Richard Hoagland has championed the idea that the Face is
    artificial, intended to resemble a human, and erected by an
    extraterrestrial civilization. Most other analysts concede that the
    resemblance is most likely accidental. Other Viking images show a
    smiley-faced crater and a lava flow resembling Kermit the Frog elsewhere
    on Mars. There exists a Mars Anomalies Research Society (sorry, don't
    know the address) to study the Face.

    The Mars Observer mission will carry an extremely high-resolution
    camera, and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this
    question in a few years. In the meantime, speculation about the Face is
    best carried on in the altnet group alt.alien.visitors, not sci.space or
    sci.astro.

Ted, you're missing a vital point.  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a
previous response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was
because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on
a constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,
on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.
 If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a
different story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to
hire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is
an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets
game at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from
baseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,
that's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start
suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time
under whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining
to play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the
differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I
would think that you'd reconsider your thoughts.

"A couple of questions for you firearms law experts out there:  

Question #1

According to the NRA/ILA state firearms lawbook, in Wisconsin it is
'unlawful for any person except a peace officer to go armed* with a 
""concealed and dangerous weapon.""  There is no statutory provision for
obtaining a lixense or permit to carry a concealed weapon.'

*  Jury instructions indicate that 'to go armed' one must have a firearm
on one's person or within his immediate control and available for use.



Does this mean that open carry is allowed?  If so, just how 'open' does it
have to be?  Would an in the pants holster be considered concealing?  What
if one had their jacket on and it partially covered the weapon?  Also,
is there any way to be allowed to carry concealed, or is it just not allowed,
period? 

Question #2

As I understand it, in Evanston, IL, they have a ordinance banning handguns.
Is there any way to get around this provision?  What would the penalty if
you were found out be?  What if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting
in your apartment there?  How would the city law apply to your impending 
trial for the shooting?
Also, what is IL state law concerning short barreled weapons?  Short barreled
shotgun is what I would be interested in if a handgun were not available, 
either that or a shortened 9mm carbine (ie Colt, Marlin).

There is a whole constellation of custom built navigation beacon satellites
in the process of being phased out right now. The TRANSIT/OSCAR satellites
are being replaced by GPS. Or were you thinking of deep space navigation,
which is best done with doppler/VLBI/ stellar measurements. I do not think
additional radio beacons would help much.",space

"I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment
of WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to
both stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike
Lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the 
big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance
He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he 
had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  
  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:
Morning show:
  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, 
and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti
had a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries
to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of
sports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he
interjects humor and politics into his show.
10 AM to 12 Noon:
  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their
abilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the
advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller
who is asking about who the local team is going to draft
in the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get
better interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that
they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless
it was a major story.
  I would consider this even because they are two different
styles of host.

12 Noon to 2 PM:
  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to 
Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been
on for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability
to transcend the ""homer"" mentality of the Philadelphia fan
base.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia 
spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.
Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0
score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys')
I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight
and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating
hosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on 
either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and
you can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.

2PM to 4PM:
  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and 
Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided
in my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,
but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10
to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do
get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so
it is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the
appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which
are often hilarious.  

4 PM to 7 PM:
  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like
Mike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.  
I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he
was at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly
homer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there
is a game on that night, but you will see later for the 
reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.

7 PM to Midnight:
  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes
Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on
charges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my
nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go
nuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)
On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets
Jets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the
west coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course
I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but
WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.
(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the
IGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))
During the summer, it
is all talk on WIP.


Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with
the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and
12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

"Hi to all out there.  We have this problem, and I'm not certain I'm solving it
in the correct way.  I was wondering if anyone can shed light on this, or point
me in the right place to look...

We have an X-ray imaging camera and a metallic tube with a cylindrical hole
passing through it at a right angle to the tube's axis:

                                                          |
                                     ||                   [ image
                                                          |
  X-ray source ]                     ||                   | screen
                            metallic || tube              |
                                     ||                   |
                                                          |

We know source--screen centre distance, radius of the tube, radius of the hole.

We do some calculations based on the image of the hole on the screen.  However,
the calculations are mathematically highly complex, and must assume that the
object's hole projects an image (resembling an ellipse if the tube is not
parallel to the screen) in the centre of the screen.  However, it is unlikely
that the object is placed so conveniently.  

Firstly, we must transform the major and minor axis of the ellipse.  I cannot
know what the angle between the tube and screen is.  Do I have to assume that
they are parallel to do the transformation?  How do I do this transformation?

Secondly, there is a distortion of the image due to the screen being planar
(the source--screen distance increases as we move away from the centre of the
screen).  How can I compensate the ellipse's axis for this image distortion?

So, please can anyone give us a few pointers here?  How do we transform the
image so it appears as it would if it were in the centre of the screen, and how
do I deal with distortion due to the shape of the screen?

We'd appreciate any help, either posted or emailed.

"There were some recent developments in the dispute about Masonry among
Southern Baptists.  I posted a summary over in bit.listserv.christia, and
I suppose that it might be useful here.  Note that I do not necessarily
agree or disagree with any of what follows: I present it as information.

 *

For a short summary:  a Southern Baptist named Larry Holly wrote a book
claiming that Freemasonry is a religion incompatible with Christianity.
(Mr Holly's father rejects Christianity, and Mr Holly blames that on the
Masons.)

The SBC's Home Missions Board includes an interfaith witness department,
which studies other religions and how to teach them about Christ.  A few
years ago, they were ordered to produce a report on Masonry: they concluded
that it was not a religion, and therefore was outside their speciality.
However, Mr Holly led a movement of people who oppose Masonry, and
last year the Convention again ordered the HMB to study Masonry.  (I got the
feeling that they were saying ""You got the wrong answer last time, try to
do better and get the answer we want."")

Anyway, there's been a bit of infighting and some inappropriate actions, but
the dust has settled and the report is in.  Nobody is entirely happy with it,
but everybody seems willing to live with it.  Both sides are saying things
such as: ""This was the best we were going to get in the current environment.""

The report commends the Masons for the charity work they do, such as the
hospitals and burn centers they operate, as well as efforts to help the
elderly and prevent drug abuse.  The report acknowledges that many well-
known Christians are and have been Masons, and notes that many teachings
of Masonry are ""supportive of Christian faith and practice"".  Examples of
the latter include belief in God, emphases on honesty and integrity, and
that some Masonic lodges incorporate explicit Christian beliefs.

On the other hand, they note that some aspects of Masonry are incompatible
with Southern Baptist principles.  These included the use of titles which some
people consider sacrilegious, the taking of certain oaths (even though they
are not meant seriously), the ""undeniably pagan and/or occultic"" writings of
some Masonic leaders, the implication in some Masonic writings that salvation
can be achieved by good works, and the racial discrimination practiced by many
Masonic lodges.  (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churches as a whole
aren't really in a place to speak on this last point.)


The report concludes that Masonry is not a religion, and says that membership
should not be endorsed or censured, but left to the discretion of individuals.
This was in part because there is variation among different Masonic Lodges,
and while one may include elements strongly against Christianity, another may
not.  Many Southern Baptists have strong convictions about the priesthood of
the believer and the autonomy of the local church, and this history probably
influenced how the report came out.

 *

The information above was gleaned from ""The Religious Herald"", a publication
of the Baptist General Association of Virginia, and ""Baptists Today"", which
does not have any direct links to a religious organisation.  (Autonomy is a
big issue among some Baptists.  8-)

Because I have neither the report itself, nor whatever Masonic documents are
relevant to these issues, none of the above comes with a guarantee.  Your
mileage may vary.  Void where prohibited.

I don't know.  You tell me.  What percentage of players reach or 
exceed their MLE's *in their rookie season*?  We're talking about
1993, you know.


If that were your purpose, maybe.  Offerman spent 1992 getting 
acclimated, if you will.  The Dodgers as a team paid a big price
that season.  Perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road.
Do you really think they would have done what they did if they
were competing for a pennant?


For a stat-head, I'm amazed that you put any credence in spring
training.  Did you notice who he got those 10 (!) hits off of, or
are you going to tell me that it doesn't make a difference?


Wait a minute.  I missed something here.  First, forget Keith
Mitchell.  Are you saying that a kid who moves from AA to AAA
and then does not improve would have been better off making a
direct leap to the majors?  If a player does well at AA and then
does not improve at AAA, isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't
belong in the bigs?

Now, Keith Mitchell.  As I recall (no stat books handy - surprise!)
he jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991.  He did so well that he was
returned to the minors, where he didn't do very well at all.  Now
his career is in jeopardy.  So how does he fit in with your 
point.  Good MLE's in AA.  Moved him right to the big club.  Now
he's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.
Duh.



Well, I've cast my lot.  Certainly you may understand better how 
good Lopez is.  And I may overvalue experience.  But neither one

NETWORK RESOURCES

OVERVIEW

    You may be reading this document on any one of an amazing variety of
    computers, so much of the material below may not apply to you. In
    general, however, systems connected to 'the net' fall in one of three
    categories: Internet, Usenet, or BITNET. Electronic mail may be sent
    between these networks, and other resources available on one of these
    networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to
    special 'servers'.

    The space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of
    several mechanisms with (mostly) transparent connections between them.

    One mechanism is the mailing list, in which mail is sent to a central
    distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list. In
    addition to the general lists for space (called SPACE Digest for
    Internet users, and SPACE on BITNET), there are a number of more
    specialized mailing lists described below.

    A second mechanism is Usenet 'netnews'. This is somewhat like a bulletin
    board operating on each system which is a part of the net. Netnews
    separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a
    'group name'. The groups dealing most closely with space topics are
    called 'sci.space.news', 'sci.space', 'sci.space.shuttle', 'sci.astro',
    and 'talk.politics.space'. Contributors 'post' submissions (called
    'articles' in netnews terminology) on their local machine, which sends
    it to other nearby machines. Similarly, articles sent from nearby
    machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems, so
    that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the Usenet
    sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was
    posted.

    Gateway machines redirect the Usenet sci.space group into Internet and
    BITNET mailing lists and vice versa; the other Usenet groups are not
    accessible as mailing lists. If you can receive netnews, its more
    flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make
    it the preferred option.

MAILING LISTS

    SPACE Digest is the main Internet list, and is now being run by the
    International Space University (in only its second change of management
    in over a decade). Email space-request@isu.isunet.edu (message body
    should be in the format 'subscribe space John Public') to join. Note
    that the moderated SPACE Magazine list is defunct at present for lack of
    a moderator. Old copies of SPACE Digest since its inception in 1981 are
    available by anonymous FTP. Retrieve
	julius.cs.qub.ac.uk:pub/SpaceDigestArchive/README
    for further details.

    Elements is a moderated list for fast distribution of Space Shuttle
    Keplerian Elements before and during Shuttle flights. NASA two line
    elements are sent out on the list from Dr. Kelso, JSC, and other sources
    as they are released. Email to elements-request@telesoft.com to join.

    GPS Digest is a moderated list for discussion of the Global Positioning
    System and other satellite navigation positioning systems. Email to
    gps-request@esseye.si.com to join.

    Space-investors is a list for information relevant to investing in
    space-related companies. Email Vincent Cate (vac@cs.cmu.edu) to join.

    Space-tech is a list for more technical discussion of space topics;
    discussion has included esoteric propulsion technologies, asteroid
    capture, starflight, orbital debris removal, etc. Email to
    space-tech-request@cs.cmu.edu to join. Archives of old digests and
    selected excerpts are available by anonymous FTP from
    gs80.sp.cs.cmu.edu (128.2.205.90) in /usr/anon/public/space-tech,
    or by email to space-tech-request if you don't have FTP access.

    SEDS-L is a BITNET list for members of Students for the Exploration and
    Development of Space and other interested parties. Email
    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET with a message saying ""SUBSCRIBE SEDS-L your
    name"". Email saying ""INDEX SEDS-L"" to list the archive contents.

    SEDSNEWS is a BITNET list for news items, press releases, shuttle status
    reports, and the like. This duplicates material which is also found in
    Space Digest, sci.space, sci.space.shuttle, and sci.astro. Email
    LISTSERV@TAMVM1.BITNET saying ""SUBSCRIBE SEDSNEWS your name"" to join.
    Email saying ""INDEX SEDSNEWS"" to list the archive contents.

    Ron Baalke (baalke@kelvin.jpl.nasa.gov) runs a mailing list which
    carries the contents of the sci.space.news Usenet group. Email him
    to join the list.

    As a general note, please mail to the *request* address to get off a
    mailing list. SPACE Digest, for example, relays many inappropriate
    'please remove me from this list' messages which are sent to the list
    address rather than the request address.

If I have a habit that I really want to break, and I am willing to
make whatever sacrifice I need to make to break it, then I do so.
There have been bad habits of mine that I've decided to put forth the
effort to break, and I've done so; there have been other bad habits
that I've decided are not worth the effort to break.  It's my choice,
either way.

I am my own master.  I choose what I want to do.  I weigh the benefits
of my actions against their consequences, and I use my experience to
help me deal with the unexpected, which in turn make me more experienced.

I don't always succeed, but I never fail, either -- I learn.

Do *you* have any habits you can't break?  Why not?


I have arrived at my own understanding of Christianity, just as you've
probably arrived at your own understanding of Islam that is most
likely very different from the way a Moslem thinks of his religion.
Are you ""unable to master your lack of desire to understand even the
slightest concept of the Quran""?  If that's different, then how is it
different from what you accuse me of?  Can I accuse you of having no
desire to understand even the slightest concept of atheism?


Of COURSE not.  That's disgusting.  For centuries, religions have been
discriminating on sex and treating women as second-class humans;
that's one of the reasons I renounced my Christianity.


No.  I don't insult people.  Period.  It's not in my nature, and it's
not something that I want to do, either.


Not yet -- but my life is the ground I use to practice on.  The fun is
in the getting there!


We don't start out perfect; we've got to strive to be something
better.  I know my shortcomings, and I know my strengths, and I live
my life according to the decisions I make, and I am content to abide
with the consequences of my decisions as easily as I'll accept the
praise for them.  There have been times in my life when I've made
mistakes, yes; I try to never make the same mistake twice.


I regard Christ as a myth.  I feel that there are far too many people
offering far too many interpretations of what he supposedly said and
did.  The only person who can really judge me is *me*.  I choose the
roads I travel, and I decide whether or not I want to reach the end of
any given road or turn back -- and as long as I don't *always* turn
back, there's no shame in it.  When I need help, I seek out my friends.


And you don't have a clue about what I'm saying, either.  Open your
eyes and SEE; open your ears and LISTEN.  I'm not just spouting off
empty words.  This is my LIFE, this is what gives me MEANING.


Huh?  You're going WAY off the track here.

I say my mother loves me.  How do I know, you ask?  I can point to
definite things she's done for me, and I can even just bring her to
you so you can ask her, face-to-face.

You say your deity loves you.  How do you know, I ask?  You can't even
convince me that it exists!


If any god dangles 'heaven' before me like a carrot, promising untold
pleasures to me if I'll only suspend my disbelief and ignore my
rationality for just this once, then I would choose 'hell'.  I can
*not* lie to myself to placate another being, no matter how powerful
it is.

Note also that there are several gods trying to lure me this way:
Yahweh, Allah, Zeus, Odin, Ra...  Please give me a solid reason to
choose one of them over the others.

[ description of Kendigism deleted -- hee hee! ]


That paragraph demonstrates that you haven't listened to a single word
I've said.

Have you ever gone to an amusement park?  Why?  I mean, after a few
hours, it closes, and nothing's different except that you're a few
dollars lighter.  Going to the amusement park doesn't do you any good
at all.  Why do you do such a meaningless thing?

The answer is that you think it's fun.  You play the skee-ball over
and over because you'd like to get better at it, even though you're
not going to win anything better than a stuffed animal even if you
blow ten dollars on it.  You ride the roller coaster because it's an
thrilling experience, even though (because?) it scares the dickens out
of you.

In the same way, I think life is fun.  And I don't intend to leave the
amusement park of life until they close down for the night!  :-D


So you (and your holy book) say.  By the same token, therefore, Santa
Claus delivers toys every xmas.  Don't you see?  I have NO REASON to
believe that what you say is true.  Please give me some reason that I
can't similarly apply to Santa Claus.


I can't do it, because your existence means nothing more to me than
just your communications over the net.  You have no more bearing on
nor importance in my life than that; remove it, and you will cease to
be significant to me.

Are you thereby inferring that your deity is nothing more than a
collection of verses in a book, and cannot be supported without
invoking them?

Or do you mean that the existence of your deity (and, in fact, any
other deity that can be written about) is as real as your own
existence?

Why do you believe what you believe?

"Our group recently bought a Mitsubishi P78U video printer and I could use some
help with it.  We bought this thing because it (1) has a parallel data input in
addition to the usual video signal inputs and (2) claimed to print 256 gray
level images.  However, the manual that came with it only describes how to
format the parallel data to print 1 and 4 bit/pixel images.  After some initial
problems with the parallel interface I now have this thing running from a
parallel port of an Hewlett-Packard workstation and I can print 1 and 4
bit/pixel images just fine.  I called the Mitsubishi people and asked about the
256 level claim and they said that was only available when used with the video
signal inputs.  This was not mentioned in the sales literature.  However they
did say the P78U can do 6 bit/pixel (64 level) images in parallel mode, but
they didn't have any information about how to program it to do so, and they
would call Japan, etc.

Frankly, I find it hard to believe that if this thing can do 8 bit/pixel images
from the video source, it can't store 8 bits/pixel in the memory.  It's not
like memory is that expensive any more.  If anybody has any information on
getting 6 bit/pixel (or even 8 bit/pixel) images out of this thing, I would
greatly appreciate your sending it to me.

Another word (offense) makes them my pick for last too.
(Well, there's also my policy of never picking a Buck Rodgers' team for last)


The 1961 Angels were  1/2 game out of 7th. The Athletics and 
expansion Senators finished tied for last. 
The 1962 Colt 45's finshed 8th - ahead of the Cubs (the Mets were last).
The 1969 Royals finshed 4th - ahead of the White Sox (the Pilots in last).
The 1977 Mariners finished 6th - ahead of the Athletics(in last).

Apparently being an expansion team with a poor A's or Chicago 
team around is a `good thing'


This may be an appropriate comparison.
The 1929-31 Yankees finshed 2nd, 3rd and 2nd finshing 
18, 16 and 13-1/2 games out of first. 
In 1933,'34 and '35 they also finished second ( though they were only
7, 7 and 3 games out).
Even great teams can lose - That's why they play the season.

who can be counted on to pitch a strong game to keep his team from going

	The Braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description,

	What the Braves lack, however, is an offensive stopper,
somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump.

"I have been convinced of the right of AMericans to an effective 
self-defense, but something strikes me as odd among the
pro-RKBA arguments presented here.

The numbers comparing hundreds of thousands (indeed, even a
million) of instances of law abiding citizens deterring
criminal activity, seem valid to me.  Likewise the number
of gun-caused homicides each year (about 11,000/year?).  However,
it is surprising that the ""Evil AntiGun Empire "" (Darth Vader
breathing sound effect here) never tries to compare
""All legitimate gun defenses"" vs. ""All gun crimes.""  Instead, 
it's always ""All legitimate gun defenses,""  which includes
cases in which the criminals are shot but not killed, and
cases in which the criminal is not here, vs. just 
criminal gun homicides, which only includes case sin which
the victim died.

Why is this?  Of course, it wouldn't be unreasonable to say
that in each crime already measured (involving guns), the
consequnces are already known and it is safe to assume that
a gun-based bank robbery last week will not suddenly turn
into a gun-basd robbery+homicide.  Whereas in the legitimate
gun defenses, one may assume that all those criminals who
were deterred would have committed more crime or more
serious crimes had they not been deterred.

"Speech by Pete Worden
                                    
          Delivered Before the U.S. Space Foundation Conference

                             April 15, 1993


     What a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble.  For
providing me this forum I would sincerely like to thank the U.S.
Space Foundation.  My topic today is the Single Stage Rocket
Technology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to
lower the cost and make rapid progress.  SSRT is to my mind --
and I hope to convince you -- the erupting a new rallying cry for
our generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.

     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the passing of a
torch from one technical generation to another.  It is a new
thing to be sure -- but it is also a relearning of old things
from past masters.

     When we rolled out the SSRT baby two weeks ago, so called
experts told us it violates the laws of physics -- it made no
sense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of
the Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Times that it,
""defies the best principles of launching payloads into space."" 
Well Dr. Rachtin -- you've made us mad!  What are these
principles that SSRT defies?

     Well I'll tell you.  It violates the principle that you need
a giant program office to build space hardware.  It violates the
""fact"" that it takes 20 years to build something new.  And it
violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for
less than many billions of dollars.

     It took some of the last generation's experts to teach us
some new/old lessons.  Werhner Von Braun's first rocket was not a
Saturn V.  General Schriever's ICBM's didn't take ten years to
demonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn't cost $1 billion.

     It took one of the great engineers of the 1950's to remind
us of these truths -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, was a
senior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,
cheaper success story.  Max has been persistent in a vision of a
single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960's. 
Because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps - Build a
little, Test a little.

     Next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration.  We
didn't solicit a bunch of requirements -- they'd just change
every few years anyway.  [ not included in the speech -- The
ALS/NLS has such ephemeral requirements that it would better
known as ""Shape Shifter"" than ""Space Lifter.""  We didn't spend a
lot money -- this X-Rocket only cost $60 million.  When's the
last time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn't
take a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Douglas completed it in
18 months.  Finally, the government program office consisted of
one very over-worked Air Force Major -- motivated in part by the
threat that he'd get to ride on it in a strapped-on lawn chair if
it ran over cost or schedule.

     As I described what SSRT is -- and isn't keep in mind its
only a first step.  There are several more steps -- and steps
that can easily fail -- before the U.S. can field an SSTO.  But
each step should follow the same principles -- a small management
team -- a few years technology demonstration -- and a modest
budget.

     Let me show a few details on SSRT and how it might evolve:
(See charts)

     I'm embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last
generation -- the giants of the last great space era, the 1950's
and 1960's.  They went to the moon - we built a telescope that
can't see straight.  They soft-landed on Mars - the least we
could do is soft-land on Earth!

     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a
little, test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable
and routine access to space.  I know there are nay sayers among
you -- those who say SSRT is a stunt.  It needs more thermal
protection, the engines are wrong, it would be better to land
horizontally, etc, etc.

     I say to you -- we'll see you at White Sands in June.  You
bring your view-graphs, and I'll bring my rocketship.  If we do
what we say we can do, then you let us do the next step.  [ not
included in the speech:  If we fail -- you still have your
program offices, staff summary sheets, requirement analyses, and
decade long programs.]",space

: In any case, I think Viola would have made a better signing.  Why?
: Viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does
: Toronto have?

Well, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does
everyone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded
spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters
than lefthanded batters.  I just don't understand why people insist
on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium).
Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have
the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters.
I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams
may be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probably
only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters
for this reason during the regular season.

I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of
whether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have
higher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managers
go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of
the platoon advantage).

Am I missing something here?",sport

"	Usually one or two teams changes their logo or a minor
uniform change per season, but the past few seasons have been

	Any thoughts on the new (old) Reds uniforms.  I
remember seeing a Pete Rose rookie card, and unless I miss my
guess he was wearing the exact same duds.  
	The Mets (HOW ABOUT DOC'S PERFORMANCE TODAY?!!!!!) have
reinserted the Mets patch on the shoulder, and changed the Mets
insgnia on the front of the jersey.  To my knowledge it is the
first time that has been changed since 1962, and it reminds me
a little of the Dodger logo.  
	Many teams have opted for a return to a previous style
of uniform, or at least uniforms that look more traditional.
(Phillies, Reds, Expos, White Sox, Padres, etc.) and the once
bright colors have been altered to gray.  The trend has also
seen the newer baseball fields resembling the parks of the
early years, as opposed to the cookie-cutter saucer stadiums
construcrted throughout the sixties.

"I've noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict
the Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubs....how?

First Base:

Grace vs Destrade...Could Destrade be the second coming of Cecil
Fielder? I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations,
then even, otherwise, edge to Cubs

Second Base:

Sandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge
to Cubs...a big edge.

Shortstop:

Vizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an
automatic out at bat. Weiss isn't much better with the stick. Even.

Third Base:

Dave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter.
Buechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to
Florida.

Catcher: 

Santiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to
Marlins

Left Field:

Conine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential.
I watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves
himself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position
where Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year.

Center:

Scott Pose vs Wilson/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the
Cubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May
isn't Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays
full time.

Right:

Felix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does
Sosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs

Starters:

Aquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won't
remind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard
is average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs

Middle Relief:

Even. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins.
Carpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy.

Closer:

A healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but
no Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save.
Look for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with
a better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida.

Overall, an edge to Chicago.
Neither of these teams will threaten to win anything, of course.

Fokker's, Nungesser and other multi-engine projects). However Lindbergh

    The 40-page publication boasts 69 listings for summer and full-time job
    opportunities as well as graduate school programs. The second edition of
    ""Space Jobs"" features strategies for entering the space field and
    describes positions at consulting and engineering firms, NASA, and
    non-profit organizations. The expanded special section on graduate
    schools highlights a myriad of programs ranging from space manufacturing
    to space policy. Additional sections include tips on becoming an

    DC-X SINGLE-STAGE TO ORBIT (SSTO) PROGRAM

    SDI's SSRT (Single Stage Rocket Technology) project has funded a
    suborbital technology demonstrator called DC-X that should fly in
    mid-1993. Further development towards an operational single-stage to
    orbit vehicle (called Delta Clipper) is uncertain at present.

    An collection of pictures and files relating to DC-X is available by
    anonymous FTP or email server in the directory

    HOW TO NAME A STAR AFTER A PERSON

    Official names are decided by committees of the International
    Astronomical Union, and are not for sale. There are purely commercial
    organizations which will, for a fee, send you pretty certificates and
    star maps describing where to find ""your"" star. These organizations have
    absolutely no standing in the astronomical community and the names they
    assign are not used by anyone else. It's also likely that you won't be
    able to see ""your"" star without binoculars or a telescope. See the back
    pages of Astronomy or other amateur astronomy publications for contact
    info; one such organization may be found at:

	International Star Registry
	34523 Wilson Road
	Ingleside, IL 60041

    Marco's Miniatures of Dracut, Mass. have produced a 1/144 Skylab in an
    edition of 500 & a 1/48 Lunar Rover (same scale as Monogram and Revell
    Lunar Modules) in a similar edition. Prices are $45 for Skylab, $24 for
    LRV. Check with them for postage etc. I have no connection with them,
    but have found their service to be good and their stock of rare/old kits
    *is* impressive. Prices range from reasonable ($35 for Monogram 1/32
    scale Apollo CSM with cutaway details) to spectacular ($145 for Airfix
    Vostok).

	""Fusion as Electric Propulsion"", Robert W. Bussard, Journal of

	    Fusion rocket engines are analyzed as electric propulsion
	    systems, with propulsion thrust-power-input-power ratio (the
	    thrust-power ""gain"" G(t)) much greater than unity. Gain values
	    of conventional (solar, fission) electric propulsion systems are
	    always quite small (e.g., G(t)<0.8). With these, ""high-thrust""
	    interplanetary flight is not possible, because system
	    acceleration (a(t)) capabilities are always less than the local
	    gravitational acceleration. In contrast, gain values 50-100
	    times higher are found for some fusion concepts, which offer
	    ""high-thrust"" flight capability. One performance example shows a
	    53.3 day (34.4 powered; 18.9 coast), one-way transit time with
	    19% payload for a single-stage Earth/Mars vehicle. Another shows
	    the potential for high acceleration (a(t)=0.55g(o)) flight in
	    Earth/moon space.

	    demonstrated a 10**10 neutron flux with their device back in

	    stability of the Soviet Tokamak. Hirsch, responsible for the
	    panic, has recently recanted and is back working on QED. -- Jim
	    Bowery]

	""PLASMAKtm Star Power for Energy Intensive Space Applications"", by
	Paul M. Koloc, Eight ANS Topical Meeting on Technology of Fusion
	Energy, special issue FUSION TECHNOLOGY, March 1989.

	    Aneutronic energy (fusion with little or negligible neutron
	    flux) requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times
	    larger than can be delivered by current approaches. If plasma
	    pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds
	    could be achieved in aneutronic fuels, then high power densities
	    and very compact, realtively clean burning engines for space and
	    other special applications would be at hand. The PLASMAKtm
	    innovation will make this possible; its unique pressure
	    efficient structure, exceptional stability, fluid-mechanically
	    compressible Mantle and direct inductive MHD electric power
	    conversion advantages are described. Peak burn densities of tens
	    of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the
	    multi-gigawatt electric output size. Engineering advantages
	    indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost. [I
	    strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously. Bob
	    Hirsch, the primary proponent of the Tokamak, has recently
	    declared Koloc's PLASMAKtm precursor, the spheromak, to be one
	    of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather
	    than Tokamak. Aside from the preceeding appeal to authority, the
	    PLASMAKtm looks like it finally models ball-lightning with solid
	    MHD physics. -- Jim Bowery]

Are you your own master?  Do you have any habits that you cannot break?
For one, you seem unable to master your lack of desire to understand
even the slightest concept of the Bible.  Seems that ignorance has you
mastered.  How about sexual sins?  Gotta any of those secret desires
in your head that you harbor but can get control of?   Do you dehumanize
women when they walk past you?  Do you degrade them to a sex object in
your head?  Are you the master of that kind of thinking?  Do you insult
people unknowingly, then regret it later.  Yet do it again the next
time opportunity presents itself?  Are you truly the master of yourself?

I have admitted that I am not the master of my thought life at all times.
That I sometimes say things I do want to say, and then repeat my mistake
unwantingly.  I have admitted to myself that I cannot control every aspect
of my being.  There are times I know I shouldn't say something, but
then say it anyway.  There are times I simply forget a lesson.
I, in fact, am not my own master.  I need help.  Jesus promised me
this help.  And I took him up on his offer.  I have willfully let
Jesus be my master because Jesus knows what is better for me than
I myself do.  And why not?  Does not the creator know his creation
better than the creation?  Does Toyota know what's better for the
Corolla than the Corolla?


Then I guess ignorance is bliss for you.  Because Brian, you enjoy
not having a clue about the Bible.   



Can you witness motherly love with your senses?  How does caring and
concern for you register with your senses?  If nothing registers
to you other than what you can see, taste, smell, hear and touch,
then you better become a Vulcan and fast.  You better get rid
of your emotions.

And I do have a good reason to believe what I do.



The topic was about my God and your lack of knowledge about what my
God says.   My God says that you will not CEASE EXISTING.  You have
life forever.  You can choose to either live it in hell in eternal
torment where there is no communication whatsoever, or can choose to 
live it in paradise with God.  That is what my God says.  And that
was the issue.  Your made-up theism is what it is--made up.  It's
wishful thinking.
 

Is this the religion of Kendigianism?  Most people are not Christian.  Most
people, including Christians,  are not fond of feeling that they
are imperfect.  Is ""the world an undesireable place"" a doctrine
of Kendigianism?  It has nothing to do with my God.  Does
Kendigism have magical mystical prayers as a part of its worship?
Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism believe that the world will be holy again?  
Mine doesn't.  Does Kendigianism also dictate that one must obey what the
priest tells them like good little sheep?  Mine doesn't.  Is this
a bunch of lies you tell yourself so that you can justify being 
ignorant of the Bible?

Brian, following Christ has nothing to do with the doctrines of Kendigianism.
You would find any of your doctrines in the Bible.   I don't follow Kendigianism.
I follow Christ.   Also, to try to again show you your ignorance
of Christ and the Bible in regards to ""priests"",  have you not read about
the sole Melchizedek priest in Hebrews 7 and 8?  Have you not read what the
purpose is of the Old Testament Levitical priesthood and why there should
NOT be priests today?  Yes, guess what?  The Catholics messed up.  I do
not follow Catholicism or any ""ism.""  I follow Christ.


Why would you want to live a good life?
To you, you die and that's it.  Don't contradict yourself.  You have
no reason to live a good life.  It doesn't do you any good in the
end.  Your life doesn't do anybody else any good  either because
everyone dies anyway.  So you have no reason to lead a good life. Leading
a good life is meaningless.   Why do you do such a meaningless thing?


Has the resurrection sunk in?  Jesus is alive.  Jesus is NOT dead.
Jesus was sacrified to fufill the Old Testament sacrificial system
in its every detail.  Jesus's death was like a seed.  He needed
to fall to the ground so that many new lives would take root.  Did
you miss the entire John passage as well?

	It isn't so much a matter of 'interpretation' of Bible texts 
that sets Mormonism apart from orthodoxy as it is a matter of 
*fabrication*.

	About 20 years ago, _National Lampoon_ had some comic strips 
in them that were drawn by Neal Adams. They were called ""Son o' God"" comics. 
It was a parody of the Jesus in the Bible. In the comic, there were a 
group of thirteen Jewish kids from Brooklyn, and when one of them said 
the magic word, he turned into ""Son o' God."" He went from a myopic, 
curly headed, yarmulke wearing boy to a replica of the stylizied 
portraits of Jesus --- with long flowing brown hair and gentile 
features.	

	Now, if someone were to profess faith in this NatLamp Jesus, 
and claim that they were a Christian because they believed in this 
NatLamp Jesus, we would have to say that this was fallacious since 
this Jesus was a fabrication, and did not really exist.

	This is the exact same thing that the LDS do when they claim 
that they are Christian. They profess faith in Jesus, but the Jesus 
that they profess to have faith in is as much a fabrication as the 
NatLamp Jesus was.

                           WEIRD SCIENCE

Everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying:  his lips 
move.  What may not be equally obvious is that there are 
politicians and then there are politicians -- and that the phrase 
""political science"" is subject to more than one interpretation.  

Years ago, we heard how ""scientists"" were worried that a new Ice 
Age might be coming, and later on that ""nuclear winter"" -- smoke 
and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full-scale international 
unpleasantness -- was a possibility.  Something like that may even 
have killed the dinosaurs.  

What we didn't hear was that no actual data supported any of this, 
that real-world events (the burning of Kuwaiti oil fields) tended 
to discredit it, that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken 
values that made America the most successful culture in history, 
and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the Plague 
when continents drifted together, exposing them to new germs.  

We miss a lot like this, unless we listen closely.  Prince William 
Sound, site of the famous oil spill, and Mount St. Helen's weren't 
supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least 
100 years.  That turned out not to be true, although you'd never 
know it from watching network nightly news or CNN.  It doesn't fit 
their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient, and 
that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be.  

But for once, the media aren't entirely to blame.  As ignorant of 
science as they are of everything, they trust ""scientists"" to 
unscrew the inscrutable.  The trouble is that today's ""scientists"" 
have agendas of their own.  

Nobody in government, that wellspring of scientific wherewithal, is 
going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that 
there is no respectable evidence for ""global warming"".  The money 
and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit, and 
they hate the automobile -- blamed as a major cause of the mythical 
crisis -- as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable.  

The same appears true of ""acid rain"", a deliberate hoax cooked up 
by the Environmental Protection Agency (which hates private 
industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car) and 
foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on 
specialists in different fields not talking to each other much.  

The list goes on, always with a common, disreputable thread.  
""Ozone depletion"", for which evidence is even more suspect and 
contradictory than for acid rain or global warming, is no more than 
a last, desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era 
when state central planning and the command economy have failed and 
can only find this final, withered leg to teeter on.  

Decades of anti-nuclear alarmism, resting on foundations of myth 
and panic-mongering, have failed to erase the fact that nuclear 
power is the safest, cleanest, most efficient source of energy 
known to mankind -- and more to the point, that the greater amount 
of energy there is available to any individual in society, the 
freer that individual -- and his society -- become.  

Honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and 
self-defense on crime -- conducted by investigators who began as 
ideological opponents to those concepts, but which show massive 
reductions in the latter to be the result of the former -- have 
been suppressed, most recently by the California state government.  

And what the media didn't say about recent EPA ""discoveries"" on the 
effect of ""secondhand smoking"" is that, although some harm to non-
smokers may have been detected, it was less (by an order or two of 
magnitude) than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a 
week or keeping a pet bird.  It's enough to make you wonder whether 
there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer.  

That, of course, is the real threat represented by politically 
correct science.  The world is a dangerous place.  It would be nice 
to know the hazards.  I've never believed smoking to be a healthy 
practice, but, given a lack of credibility on the part of today's 
science, how am I to decide what to do about it?  Nicotine is 
highly addictive, to that much I can attest from experience.  Yet 
the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue.  There 
isn't any way to tell, thanks to the corrupting influence of 
government money on the scientific establishment.  

Two centuries ago, the Founding Fathers spared us certain agonies 
to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one 
time or another, by creating a legal barrier between politics and 
religion.  Each time some short-sighted individual or group has 
tried to lower the barrier (most recently over the issue of 
abortion), blood -- real human blood, hot and smoking in the street 
-- has wound up being shed.  

Real human blood is being shed over scientific issues, as people's 
lives are ruined through the loss, to agencies like the EPA, of 
livelihood, or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate, 
to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels 
for electrical power, or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates, 
when they die from the effects of obesity.  

What we need now, if we hope to survive as a civilization for two 
more centuries, is another barrier, a Constitutional separation of 
state and science -- including medicine.  Knowledge is valuable; 
real science won't languish for lack of funding.  The money will 
simply come from contributors unwilling to pay for lies, and 
everyone will benefit.

_3,700-year tradition still glows - 
           'Assimilation in U.S. threatens ancient Zoroastrian religion'_

By Jeanne Huber, Mercury News Staff Writer

   HIGH ON A HILLSIDE above San Jose, flames leap up 24 hours a day from a
gleaming brass urn in a temple - one of only four in the United States -
dedicated to one of the world's most ancient religions.

   With the flames go the prayers of about 1,200 Bay Area Zoroastrians that
their faith will survive this land.

   ""There is a fear - a real fear, too,"" said Silloo Tarapore of Lafayette.
""We have one generation to do it or to die.""

   Many immigrant groups struggle to maintain an identity in a strange land.
But for Zoroastrians, it is an especially poignant concern.

   Their religion has been around for perhaps 3,700 years, a heritage so deep
it scarcely seems comprehensible in a state where ""historical sites"" are
sometimes less than 100 years old.  It was the religion of the great Persian
Empire under kings Cyrus and Darius.  And tradition says that when Christ
was born about 500 years later, he was honored by a visit from three
Zoroastrian priests, the Magi.  Scholars say many key beliefs of Christians,
Jews and Muslims can be traced to the teachings of Zoroaster, the
Zoroastrian prophet.

   Yet, with only about 150,000 Zoroastrians in the entire world, they are 
a miniscule minority in every country in which they live.  Survival as a
people is very much on their minds.

   Ironically, local Zoroastrians fear that the almost unlimited tolerance
of the United States may do what hundreds of years of persecution followed
by nearly 1,000 years of benign religious segregation could not do: cause
their young people to stop thinking of themselves as Zoroastrians.

   Zoroastrians do not believe theirs is the only right religion, and they
actually shun the notion of trying to win converts.  So if their children
become totally assimilated, they say, it's their children - rather than
the world at large - who will be the losers.

   ""It's important to have an identity,"" said Maneck Bhujwaia of San Jose,
a leader among Zoroastrians who came here from India.  ""It's important
for everybody - Irish, Scottish, Americans.  It gives meaning to life.
You don't have to depend on the majority community to give you respect.
You can fall back on your own identity.""

   For Zoroastrians, there's much to be proud of.

   Their prophet, Zoroaster, seeking to make sense of a culture in which
animal sacrifice to multiple gods was common, preached that there was
only one god, a good one.  Zoroastrians call their god Ahura Mazda, which
translates as Lord of Wisdom and Light.

_Good vs. evil_

   Zoroaster saw life as a constant struggle between good and evil, with
the good eventually winning.  Men and women could join in the battle for
good, he said, and he warned that they would inevitably suffer consequences
such as shame and sorrow if they did wrong.  He preached honesty, charity,
kindness to animals, respect for the environment, hard work, equality of
men and women - basic virtues preached by prophets of many religions.

   But Zoroaster was perhaps unusual in that he told his followers not to
follow him blindly.  He demanded they think for themselves.  In fact,
Joseph Campbell, the famous scholar of the history and meaning of myths,
traced the Western emphasis on individual thought to the Zoroastrians.

   Zoroastrians have many words for thought.  Their motto, leaded into a
stained glass window over the sacred fire at the temple on the slopes of
Mount Hamilton, is ""Good thoughts, good words, good deeds.""

   So it's not surprising that Zoroastrians value education highly.  In India,
where a contingent of Zoroastrians arrived in the ninth century to escape
persecution by Muslims in Iran, Zoroastrians claim 100 percent literacy;
the overall statistic in India is just 60 percent.

   About half of the Bay Area Zoroastrian community came here from India
and Pakistan, mostly to study at universities.  The other half fled from
Iran after the 1979 revolution made that a fundamentalist Islamic state
where others had no rights.

   Local Zoroastrians point with pride to ways their emphasis on ""good
deeds"" has improved life in every country they inhabit.  In San Jose,
the recent restoration of the Hotel Sainte Clarie came about because
Manou Mobedshahi, a San Francisco-based hotelier, passed the boarded-up
downtown landmark on his way to and from the temple.  At the temple's
dedication, the chief guest of honor was the mother of Zubin Mehta, the
Zoroastrian conductor of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra.

   The temple exists because of another good deed: the decision by an
Iranian emigre, the late Arbab Rustom Guiv, to buy land for six temples
in North America.  Besides the 10-acre site off Crothers Road on Mount
Hamilton, he paid for land in Los Angeles, Chicago, New York, Toronto,
and Vancouver.  Until his gifts, there were no Zoroastrian temples on
this continent.

   Local Zoroastrians raised money to build the actual temple, and the
property already had a large house that they have converted to a
community center.

   The temple, dedicated a year ago on the birthday of the prophet 
Zoroaster, is a simple structure with gleaming white walls, vaulted 
ceilings and oak floors, partially covered with huge Oriental carpets.

   Its central feature is the fire, set in the middle of a partly-glassed-
in area at the center of the building.  Although Zoroastrians are 
sometimes called ""fire worshippers,"" they actually consider fire just 
a symbol of God.  ""It helps us concentrate, just like Christians use the 
cross and Muslims use the Holy Book,"" Bhujwala said.

   The biggest celebration of the years occurs in early spring.  For all
Iranians, including Zoroastrians, the New Year begins on the first day of
the season because of its symbolism as the start of new life.  With
Zoroaster's birthday just six days later, the combination of religious
and secular holidays creates something on par with what most of the
United States celebrates between Christmas and Jan. 1.

  For this year's celebration of the prophet's birthday, about 500 people
came to worship and revel.

   ""The good things in life are not forbidden,"" Esfandiar Anoushiravani,
a leader of the Iranian members, had said beforehand, and what followed
proved him right.

   Inside the temple, worshipers filled every chair and sat or stood
around the edges of the room as about a half-dozen priests chanted
thanksgiving prayers around a table laden with braziers of smoking
sandalwood, glasses of milk and water, and a tray heaped with dried fruit
and nuts.

   Kids crowded around, grabbing handfuls of the treats.  ""People eat the
fruit,"" Tarapore said.  ""It's a way to participate in the ceremony.""

_Santa Claus, sort of_

   The gathering even had a Santa Claus, Iranian style.  With flowing white
hair and a bag of gifts for the children, this Amownaroz wore green
symbolic of spring) and red.

   He was ushed in by a sort of spring clown, Hajefyrouz, who danced and
played a tambourine.

   The Zoroastrians from India were charmed.  ""This is all new for us, too,""
one told a visitor who asked what was going on.

   A visitor, John A. Sabanovich of Folsom, said he became intrigued with
the religion years ago while on business trips to Iran.  Zoroastrians have
no procedure for accepting converts - a result, some say, of their
centuries of persecution in Iran followed by their promise to the Hindu
king who allowed them into India that they would not interfere with his
people's religion.

   But that does not stop Sabavich from joining in the celebrations at the
San Jose temple whenever he can.

   ""When I first heard about this religion,"" he said, ""I thought, my God,
this is what a religion should be.  They think for themselves and do good.

   ""People who don't have a tradition, something to lean on, what's the
difference with the lower animals?""",religion

OK, here's at least one Christian's answer:

Jesus was a JEW, not a Christian.  In this context Matthew 5:14-19 makes
sense.  Matt 5:17 ""Do not think that I [Jesus] came to abolish the Law or
the Prophets; I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.""  Jesus lived
under the Jewish law.  However, He was the culmination of the promises
of the Prophets.  He came to *fulfill* the prophecies and fully obey
God's purposes.

Verse 18 says ""For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass
away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pass away from the Law,
until all is accomplished.""  The key to this verse IMHO is the last 
phrase.  Jesus, as the fulfillment of the law, ""accomplished"" what the 
Law was supposed to accomplish.  

Verse 19:  ""Whoever then annuls one of the least of these commandments,
and so teaches others, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven;
but whoever keeps and teaches them, he shall be called great in the
kingdom of heaven.""  Taken in the context of Jesus teaching Jewish 
people about living lives under the law, this makes sense.

In general, it appears that Jesus is responding to some criticism he 
must have received about ""doing away with the Law.""  That was not 
Jesus' intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law as it 
should be lived and fulfill the promises made by God to his 
people all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your 
heel, but *He* will bruise his head.]  Jesus appeared to be ""doing 
away with the Law"" because he did not honor the traditions of men as 
equal to the Law of God.  He regularly locked horns with the religious 
leaders of the day because he would not conform to *their* rules, only 
God's Law.

In the Matthew passage Jesus is defending his dedication to the Law 
and defending himself against his accusors.  Almost the entire Sermon 
on the Mount (Matt. 5-7) is dedicated to helping the Jewish people 
understand the true intent of the Law, sweeping away the clutter which 
had been introduced by the Pharasees and their traditions.

In Galatians 3:23-26, Paul describes the relationship of Jesus to the 
Law in this way:

[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, being 
shut up to the faith which was later to be revealed.  [24] Therefore 
the Law has become our tutor to lead us to Christ, that we may be 
justified by faith.  [25]  But now that faith has come, we are no 
longer under a tutor.  [26] For you are all sons of God through faith 
in Christ Jesus.

I believe this says that after Christ was revealed, the Law had 
served it's purpose, i.e. ""our tutor to lead us to Christ,"" and
now, ""we are no longer under a tutor.""  The law has been ""fulfilled"" 
as Christ said he would do.

God, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesus, are the same
personality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the ""last
will and testament"" of Jesus) are based on the same moral principles. 
It makes sense that many of the principles in the old Law are
re-expressed in Christianity. 

On the other hand, now that the Law has fulfilled it's purpose and 
Christians relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also makes 
sense that new practices and new symbolisms were established to 
represent the ""mysteries"" of this new relationship.  i.e. Baptism 
representing Christ's death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),
The Lord's supper as a memorial to His sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and
Sunday as a day of worship commemorating His resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,
Acts 20:7)

OK, That's one Christian's explanation.  I don't claim to have all
these issues completely settled even in my own mind and I welcome
other Christians to offer other alternatives.

Yes, I think he should have done more to get out of the way.  As much
as fans want to catch a ball, they really should be aware that winning
the game is more important.  As a Dodger fan, he has to be aware that
this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win

instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch

"I plan to post a summary of responses to this as soon as I have working
code, which I will also include.  The intersection of 3 planes method
looks best, but my implementation based on a short article in 
Graphics Gems I doesn't work.  I may be misinterpreting, of course.

I had avoided the simultaneous solution of the plane equations in favor
of dot and cross products, but the former may actually be better.  In either
case a matrix determinant needs to be computed (implicitly in the solution
of linear equations).

To get the planes, I was taking the midpoint of the line from, say,
P1 to P2, and setting the normal as the ""normalized"" vector from P1 to P2.
These just plugged into the formula in Graphics Gems.  HOwever, the resulting
center point is only occasionally equidistant from all 4 of my test points
(for different tests).  My matrix/vector math is very rusty, but it looks like
I need to verify the formula, or use the simultaneous equation solution, which
will require bringing in another routine I don't have (but should be easy to
find).

Another method is to first find the center of the circle defined by 2 sets
of 3 points, and intersecting the normals from there.  This would also define
the circle center.  However, small numerical imprecisions would make the
lines not intersect.  Supposedly 3 planes HAVE to intersect in a unique
point if they are not parallel.

I think the passage you're looking for is the following.

Matthew 5:17    ""Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the 
prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them. 
Matthew 5:18   For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, 
not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished. 
Matthew 5:19   Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments 
and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he 
who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of 
heaven. 
Matthew 5:20   For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of 
the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. 

There are several problems with this.  The most serious is that the
Law was regarded by Jews at the time (and now) as binding on Jews, but
not on Gentiles.  There are rules that were binding on all human
beings (the so-called Noachic laws), but they are quite minimal.  The
issue that the Church had to face after Jesus' death was what to do
about Gentiles who wanted to follow Christ.  The decision not to
impose the Law on them didn't say that the Law was abolished.  It
simply acknowledged that fact that it didn't apply to Gentiles.  This
is a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.
(A discussion of the issue in more or less these terms is recorded
in Acts 15.)

However there's more involved.  In order to get a full picture of the
role of the Law, we have to come to grips with Paul's apparent
rejection of the Law, and how that relates to Jesus' commendation of
the Law.  At least as I read Paul, he says that the Law serves a
purpose that has been in a certain sense superceded.  Again, this
issue isn't one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of his
discussion, Paul notes that he might be understood this way, and
assures us that that's not what he intends to say.  Rather, he sees
the Law as primarily being present to convict people of their
sinfulness.  But ultimately it's an impossible standard, and one that
has been superceded by Christ.  Paul's comments are not the world's
clearest here, and not everyone agrees with my reading.  But the
interesting thing to notice is that even this radical position does
not entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remains as an
uncompromising standard, from which not an iota or dot may be removed.
For its purpose of convicting of sin, it's important that it not be
relaxed.  However for Christians, it's not the end -- ultimately we
live in faith, not Law.

While the theoretical categories they use are rather different, in the
end I think Jesus and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The
quoted passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest
of the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesus shows us how he interprets the
Law.  The ""not an iota or dot"" would suggest a rather literal reading,
but in fact that's not Jesus' approach.  Jesus' interpretations
emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial
details.  Indeed he is well known for taking a rather free attitude
towards the Sabbath and kosher laws.  Some scholars claim that Mat
5:17-20 needs to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish
discussions.  Jesus accuses his opponents of caring about giving a
tenth of even the most minor herbs, but neglecting the things that
really matter: justice, mercy and faith, and caring about how cups and
plates are cleaned, but not about the fact that inside the people who
use them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) This, and
the discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesus has a very specific
view of the Law in mind, and that when he talks about maintaining the
Law in its full strength, he is thinking of these aspects of it.
Paul's conclusion is similar.  While he talks about the Law being
superceded, all of the specific examples he gives involve the
""ceremonial law"", such as circumcision and the Sabbath.  He is quite
concerned about maintaining moral standards.

The net result of this is that when Paul talks about the Law being
superceded, and Jesus talks about the Law being maintained, I believe
they are talking about different aspects of the Law.  Paul is
embroiled in arguments about circumcision.  As is natural in letters
responding to specific situations, he's looking at the aspect of the
Law that is currently causing trouble: the Law as specifically Jewish
ceremonies.  He certainly does not intend to abolish divine standards
of conduct.  On the other hand, when Jesus commends the Law, he seems
to be talking the Law in its broadest implications for morals and
human relationships, and deemphasizing those aspects that were later
to give Paul so much trouble.",religion

  While Atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation, I feel that their
relief staff may be suspect.  They don't have a real closer -- although
Mike Stanton (4 saves) has been used in that role.  Didn't Stanton start off
great last year and then falter?  Despite this, your point is well taken.
Atlanta doesn't seem to have the same personality as a NY team, thus is 
unlikely to self-destruct.  For Houston to take 'em, Atlanta needs to
suffer some injuries, particularly to their starting rotation.



  From what I understand, Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the

players..  Art  Doug Jones is the key to Houston's success.  He must have
another great year for Houston to challenge in the NL West.

I don't think anyone is arguing that there would be no effect. But
there would be no _net_ _positive_ effect. You also have to 
consider the negative side: Law abiding citizens, armed with 
fireamrs (pistols for the most part), prevent between 80,000
(National Crime Survey) and 1,000,000 (Dr. Kleck) crimes
each year. (Those are the extremes. Most studies find
the number to be 500,000 to 600,000.) About 1% of those crimes are
homicides, so private ownership of firearms _saves_ approximately
5,000 lives each year. There are roughly 12,000 criminal homicides
and fatal accidents involving guns each year. For there to 
be any net benefit, you would have to show that gun control measures
would disarm over 40% of the criminals currently using guns.
That would be very hard to do: According the the federal BATF,
only 8% of criminals buy their guns over the counter. Since
gun control laws, by their very nature, only effect legal
sales, such a law would remove all the benefits of armed,
law-abiding citizens while having only a minimal effect on
armed criminals (who, by and large, get their guns illegally.) 
That doesn't sound like a net benefit to me.
  

Since most were with licensed weapons, I assume you are not
supporting ""reasonable"" laws (i.e. waiting periods, background
checks, licenses, etc...). Since only a complete ban would 
alter the statistic you refer to, I assume that's what you
are supporting.

By the way, 1135 people dies in 1986 from falling down stairs.
250 accidental handgun deaths isn't significant next to 
other household accidents.


1080 children under the age of 10 died by drowning, 69 from 
drinking poisonous household chemicals (like Drano), 139 from
falls. If the real goal is to reduce the tragic, accidental
deaths of children, wouldn't a ban on drain cleaners be a 
better palce to start? (Or, perhaps, restricting ownership to
professionals like plumbers?)


While you might call it ""emphasis"", refering to completely two
statistics in the same sentence _implies_ a comparison. If it
isn't valid, and you put the numbers together to convince people
you are right, the kindest thing I could call it is propaganda.",politics

  Hey, no fair! What about 'Fettucine' Alfredo Griffin? The guy practically

plane. The first time I watched Julio Franco, I didn't think *anyone* could

caught not ready for a pitch.

  How 'bout one to add to your list: Travis Fryman? The guy plants his front

I keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot

HUBBLE TELESCOPE SERVICING MISSION SCHEDULED FOR ELEVEN DAYS

	The December flight of Endeavour on Space Shuttle mission STS-61 to
service the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) has been scheduled as an 11 day
mission designed to accommodate a record five spacewalks with the capability
for an additional two, if needed.

	The decision to schedule five extravehicular activities, or EVAs, was
reached following extensive evaluations of underwater training, maneuver times
required using the Shuttle's robot arm based on software simulations and actual
EVA tasks on previous missions.

	""Basically what we've done by going to five EVAs rather than three is
to repackage our margin so that we have the capability to respond to the
dynamics, or unknowns, of spacewalks,"" Mission Director Randy Brinkley said.
""It improves the probabilities for mission success while providing added
flexibility and adaptability for reacting to real-time situations.""

	In laying out the specific tasks to be completed on each of the
spacewalks, officials have determined that changing out the gyros, solar arrays
and the Wide Field/Planetary Camera (WF/PC) and installing the Corrective
Optics Space Telescope Axial Replacement (COSTAR) are priority objectives
during the mission.

	""When we looked at accomplishing all of the tasks, highest through
lowest priority, and recognizing that the major tasks -- gyros, solar arrays,
WF/PC and COSTAR -- would consume most of the time set aside for each
spacewalk, five EVAs were deemed appropriate,"" said Milt Heflin, Lead Flight
Director for the mission.

	While the five spacewalks will be unprecedented, the use of two
alternating spacewalk teams will alleviate placing more stress on the crew than
previous missions requiring two, three or four EVAs.

	""We have paid close attention to lessons learned during previous
spacewalks and factored these into our timeline estimates for five EVAs,""
Heflin said.  ""In planning for all Space Shuttle missions, it is necessary to
formulate a work schedule that represents as realistic a timeline as possible
to accomplish the mission objectives.""

	Planning currently calls for at least five water tank training sessions
that include support from the Mission Control Center, called joint integrated
simulations, lasting between 10 and 36 hours.  In addition, many stand alone
underwater training ""runs"" will practice individual tasks in each spacewalk.

	Various refinements to the specific tasks on each spacewalk will be
made based on actual training experience during the months prior to the
mission.  Also, lessons learned from other spacewalks leading up to the flight
will be valuable in assisting the STS-61 crew in its training techniques.

	Endeavour's June flight and Discovery's July mission both will include
spacewalks to evaluate some of the unique tools to be used on the HST mission.
The evaluations will help in better understanding the differences between the
actual weightlessness of space and the ground training in the water tanks at
the Johnson Space Center, Houston, and the Marshall Space Flight Center,
Huntsville, Ala.

	Also, the inflight spacewalking experiences will assist in gaining
further insight into the time required for the various tasks and expand the
experience levels among the astronaut corps, the flight controllers and
trainers.

	Designed to be serviced by a Space Shuttle crew, Hubble was built with
grapple fixtures and handholds to assist in the capture and repair procedures.

	The telescope was launched aboard Discovery in April 1990.  At that
time the NASA mixed fleet manifest showed the first revisit mission to HST in
1993 to change out science instruments and make any repairs that may have
become necessary.",space

I think that you are changing the meaning of ""values"" here. Perhaps
it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.

value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods
or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in 
usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality
considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as
of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus. 
The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or
lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech
sound. 

In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms
of scientific usage, definitions six or eight might apply. Note that
these definitions do not mean the same thing.

In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a
reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. Even the usages of the
word ""value"" above do not denote observable fact, but rather a standard
of measurement. I would conclude that science does not have its
basis in values, and so your statement above fails. In fact, if one
concludes that a scientific set of measurements (values) are based on
systems derived from observation, then it must follow that in a
scientific context, there is no such thing as there is no such thing as
""objective values.""

Back to the present. This has nothing to do with a moral system anyhow.
Just because the word ""values"" is used in both contexts does not mean
that there is a relationship between the two contexts.

If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must
first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering
the meaning of the word ""objective"" I doubt that this will ever happen.

So, back to the original question:

And objective morality is.....?

If you can provide an objective foundation for ""morality"" then that will
be a good beginning.

The situation in this regard has changed considerably in recent years.
See the discussion of ""high-power rocketry"" in the rec.models.rockets
frequently-asked-questions list.

This is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy; you need
proper certification.  That can be had, mostly through Tripoli (the high-
power analog of the NAR), although the NAR is cautiously moving to extend
the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too.

You need special FAA authorization, but provided you aren't doing it under
one of the LAX runway approaches or something stupid like that, it's not
especially hard to arrange.

As with model rocketry, this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled
properly.  Proper handling takes more care, and you need a lot more empty
air to fly in, but it's basically just model rocketry scaled up.  As with
model rocketry, the high-power people use factory-built engines, which

""Put not your trust in princes"" is the Biblical proverb.  The modern
analog is governments.  At the time of the founding of the US, the
idea that citizens had rights above those of the government was not
that common, but was explicit in the writings of the founders.  To a
considerable extent, Englishmen also had those rights.

Yes, times change, and technology changes.  The possibility of 
a few governments enserfing all of mankind was not possible until
quite recently.  In the feudal system, the lord was almost as
restricted as the serfs, so having the people enserf themselves
does not make anything better; most feudal lords, and even most
slaveowners, did not mistreat those under them.

"UPI Washington DC, Update Desk			4/15/93

  For the past several months the Clinton administration has been
  stymied by mixed signals coming from the economy.  While most
  leading indicators has shown an apparent improvement in the 
  economy, there has been no corresponding improvement in the area
  of jobs creation.

  The unemployment figures seem stalled at the 7% mark.  last month,
  in an effort to understand this problem, President Clinton appointed
  a blue ribbon panel to try to resolve the apparent conflicting
  economic signals.  This panel was chaired by Vice President Gore.

  Today the panel released their results, providing a shocking conclusion.
  ""It's the guns"" Vice President Gore said.  Apparently NRA members, and other
  ""gun-nuts"" are purchasing firearms at in record numbers, pulling the
  economy out of the recession.  ""Their buying them five times faster than
  ever before, and stockpiling left and right"", the Vice President said.  

  However, since many domestic firearm and ammunition manufacturers have
  been experiencing hard times during the past few years, including several
  declarations of bankruptcy by many leading American gun makers, they have
  not rushed to increase hiring to meet the new demand.

  ""We want to see if this run will continue before hiring more people"", said
  the President of Colt industries.  ""As long as Clinton is in office, we
  suspect it will"", he added.

  In response to this new information, President Clinton announced a new
  Gun Control measure to be introduced into Congress this session.  It's 
  called the ""Ban-One-A-Month"" Gun Control Bill.  Under the terms of this law,
  every make and model of all firearms will be written on individual index 
  cards.  The cards will all be put in a big hat and the President will draw
  one card every month.  Sixty days later that gun will be banned from any
  further manufacture/importation or sale in this country, except to the
  politically connected and to members of the National Police Force.

  The President said, ""This law will benefit America two ways.  When the
  Gun-Of-The-Month is announced every thirty days, the gun-nuts will run
  out and buy thousands of them, boosting the economy even more.  In addition,
  over the long run, we will get all of these icky-evil guns off of the
  street.""  He also announce the appointment of Sarah Brady to oversee
  this program, citing her ""Honesty, and unbiased view on the subject
  of gun control"".

  Senators Metzenbaum, DeConcini, Feinstein, and Boxer have proposed an
  amendment to the Bill which would add additional index cards containing
  caliber designations for all know ammunitions.  ""Their stockpiling,
  stockpiling, stockpiling"" screamed Metzenbaum during a press conference
  at the national Headquarters of Handgun Control Inc.

  Senators Simon, Metzenbaum, and Moyenhan also introduced an amendment
  that would make all guns illegal to possess once the last card has been
  drawn from the hat.  Senator Simon was quoted as saying, ""First we'll
  fuck em, then we'll kick em out of bed in the morning"", during a press
  conference he held in the second floor Mens Restroom of the Senate
  building.  He of course was referring to the fact that he would allow
  the people to purchase the guns to help the economy, but would require
  the BATF to seize all of the guns in America sometime in the year 2008,
  after all of the cards have been drawn.

  The head of the BATF responded by saying, ""We will have to see if this
  thing in Waco is over by then.  We may be too busy to seize all those
  guns"".

  US House Representatives Pat Schroeder and David Skaggs of Colorado
  declared this proposed law as being ""reasonable gun control which won't
  affect anybodys Constitutional right to own sporting guns"".

I don't think such a Canada is any more ""culturally similar"" to

Actually, they do not have ""roughly the same... urban economy"",

However, if you account for economic and ethnic differences,
the difference disappears completely: Seattle's minorities are
predominatly poor, while Vancouver's are middle or upper class.
The rates for whites in both cities were found to be identicle,
while the rate for poor, Seattle minorities was almost three
times as great as for the well-to-do minorities of Vancouver.
The pattern seems to be one of poverty and race relations, not
one of gun control.


That is a gross distortion: ""Self-defense"" does not mean killing
the attacker. There were 21 cases of civilians killing their 
attacker in self-defence. But such cases represent less that
0.5% of the crimes prevented by armed self-defence; for every
case you cite, there were over 200 other cases of self-defence
where the crime was prevented but the attacker was not killed.
(0.5%, by the way, is the most conservative possible figure,
based on the National Crime Survey's estimate of 80,000
crimes prevented by armed self-defence each year. Most other 
studies on the subject put the figure at 500,000 to 600,000.
Those figures would imply less than 0.08% of sucessful self-defences
involve killing the attacker.) 

So, more correctly, there over 4000 (possibly as many as 25,000) 
cases of civilians acting in self-defence, only 21 of which resulted
in the death of the attacker. This is a significant factor, in
comparison to the 592 homicides. If memory serves, homicides
make up approximately 1% of the violent crimes the study
considered, so the fair comparison would be 40 - 250 homicides
prevented and 592 homicides. Clearly, the study can not be
close to accurate, since it ignored these cases of self-defence.",politics

"I am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a Postscript Type 1 or
TrueType font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted
by a 3D scanline renderer. 

I have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but
have never had the need to implement such a system. Well, I now have the
opportunity to write some font rendering software so I would like to have
some of my questions answered before I jump into the deep end.

The main problem I face is how to use the even/odd or non-winding rules to
turn the outlines into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle
complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple
polygons). For example, in the letter ""O"" there are two outlines:

	1) The outside outline which is clockwise (TrueType font)
	2) The inside outline which is counterclockwise.

One common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply 
connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the
two outlines are closest. This is equivalent to descibing a ""polygon with
holes"". The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior
polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges.

I do not want to use this simplistic system since:

	1) It will not handle all outline fonts properly (it is not a simple
		matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for
		some fancy fonts).
	2) It does not properly handle the even/odd or non-winding rules.

From my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid
decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids (as
is done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizers). These trapezoidal
polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the 3D scanline renderer.

My question is: are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into
polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of this solution
since it creates excess number of polygons.

Another question, for those in the know: what is the best algorithm to create
bevelled and/or offset curves for font outlines? I have a dozen papers on these
subjects but I can't tell which method is the best to implement.

I was at an interesting seminar at work (UK's R.A.L. Space Science
Dept.) on this subject, specifically on a small-scale Solar Sail
proposed as a student space project. The guy giving the talk was keen to
generate interest in the project. I'll typein the handout he gave out at
the meeting. Here goes : 

			The Microlight Solar Sail
			-------------------------

1. Introduction
The solar sail is a well-established concept. Harnessing the pressure of
sunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimited range. In principle, such a
vehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.

However it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most
people realize. The pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per
square kilometer. Deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized
fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type
spacecraft is a daunting task. This is why, despite the potential of hte
idea, no such craft has actually been launched to date.

2.Design
Recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept: a
tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely
be electronics, with no mechanical parts. Several attitude control
methods are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a
panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn.

The key components of the craft will be a minute CCD camera developed at
Edinburgh University which can act as both attitude sensor and data
gathering device; solar cells providing ~1 watt power for control and
communication; and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface
of the sail itself. Launched as a piggyback payload, the total cost of
the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars.

3.Missions
The craft would be capable of some ambitious missions. For example:
a) It could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor
groups. Closeup pictures could be transmitted back to Earth at a low bit
rate.
b) It could be steered into a lunar polar orbit. Previously unobserved
areas around the lunar poles could be viewed. By angling the sail to
reflect sunlight downwards, polar craters whose bases never receive
sunlight could be imaged. Bright reflections would confirm that
volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these
locations.[Immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar
base, BTW]
c) It could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet
nucleus. Impacting at low speed, a thin wire probe attached to the craft
causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp-edged
tube, like performing a biopsy. Returning to Earth, the sail acts as an
ideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensures that heat
is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed ~300
deg C. The material sample is recovered, enclosed in a small insulating
container.

"Posted by Cathy Smith for L. Neil Smith

                   LETTER TO A LIBERAL COLLEAGUE

[AUTHOR'S NOTE:  ""Adrian"" -- name changed to protect the guilty -- 
and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with 
the same editor at a famous New York publishing house.]

Dear Adrian:  

I'm way behind schedule on my current book again, so this reply to 
your note -- criticizing the recent magazine interview I gave and 
generally attacking gun ownership -- will necessarily consist 
mostly of assertions you're free to believe (or not) I can back 
with evidence and logic I've neither time nor energy to present 
now.  I've written fully on this topic before and will again in the 
future.  When I do, I'll make sure you get copies.  

There are many arguments I might make, from the futility and danger 
of delegating self-defense to the police (see Don Kates in the Jan. 
10, 1985 WALL STREET JOURNAL) to the real effect of prohibition, 
shifting consumers from newly-outlawed handguns or semiautomatic 
rifles to items like sawed-off shotguns or homemade bombs, but I'll 
limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent 
with your note.  

First, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Second, publication of some latter-day ""scientific study"" doesn't 
alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists I discussed in my 
interview -- annoying you so much in the process -- were lying.  

Third, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Fourth, as often happens with these things, the ""study"" doesn't 
support the gun prohibitionists' original numerical contentions 
anyway, but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older 
body of lies, omissions, and distortions.  

Fifth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Sixth, the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on 
countless occasions (Carl Bakal, author of NO RIGHT TO KEEP AND 
BEAR ARMS, even confessed to it publicly) makes the value of this 
present ""study"" dubious, to say the least.  

Seventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is 
a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, 
and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic 
process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Eighth, given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat 
(not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction), you 
should be better aware than most people how ""progress"" -- in 
designing ""studies"" to prove whatever you want -- outstrips our 
ability to collect meaningful data.  A case in point we might agree 
on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist 20 or 30 
years to create ""studies"" ""proving"" that pornography causes crime.  
More naive (and probably more honest) efforts in the 50s and 60s 
clearly indicate the contrary.  

Ninth, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Tenth, another reason to doubt all such ""studies"" is that human 
behavior (as the Austrian School of economics demonstrates) is far
too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified.  The 
attempt to do so -- and then create public policy based on the 
resulting pseudo-information -- is wrecking our civilization.  

Eleventh, the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is 
a natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, 
and Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic 
process nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

Twelfth, the ""study"" is also worthless because it incorporates 
figures for suicide, which is not necessarily a tragedy but 
basically another individual right, sometimes with ancillary social 
benefits.  If anything, perhaps suicide INTERVENTION should be a 
criminal offense.  

Thirteenth and finally, the National Rifle Association officials 
quoted in the article, whatever their shortcomings (and they are 
many), are correct in this instance:  the ""study"" is meaningless 
because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a 
natural, fundamental, and inalienable human, individual, civil, and 
Constitutional right -- subject neither to the democratic process 
nor to arguments grounded in social utility.  

And because of that, Adrian, even if the ""study"" were valid, it 
wouldn't deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that 
anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however, 
whenever, and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody's 
permission. In this I'm ably assisted by gun prohibitionists 
themselves, whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed 
people to go out and buy their first gun ""while they still can"".  
Before the '68 Gun Control Act, most of the ""shooting fraternity"" 
viewed handguns (incorrectly, as it turned out) as inaccurate, 
ineffective toys.  There probably weren't six million of them in 
the whole country.  Now, thanks to Kennedy, Metzenbaum, the Bradys, 
and their ilk -- AMERICA'S GREATEST SPORTING GOODS SALES TEAM -- we 
probably manufacture at least that many every year.

The fascinating datum is that Handgun Control, et al. are perfectly 
aware of this -- so I guess you'll have to ask them yourself what 
their real motives are.  

Look:  gun-making isn't an arcane or difficult art (and by the way, 
it's easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic; 
the fact that I can still obtain my own weapon of preference, the 
self-loading pistol, is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing 
this further).  Even if it were difficult, there are already a 
quarter billion firearms in America, with an estimated ""half life"" 
of 1000 years -- possibly more for stainless steel.  Guns are gonna 
be around a long time, Adrian, whether you like it or not.

As for me, to paraphrase Elmer Keith, regardless of what the law 
provides or any court decides, I'm always going to be armed.  And I 
will always work to see that others are, as well.  The bad news is 
that there are thousands more -- perhaps even hundreds of thousands 
-- where I come from.  We can't be stopped by passing laws, we can 
only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and -- given 
both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics 
and semiautomatics -- perhaps more efficiently.  

So what's the point?

Where does it say in the bible that Christians are supposed to persecute
Jews?  Isn't it love your enemies instead?  They may say they are ""Christian""
but do their actions speak differently?  Do you believe what everyone tells
you?  I don't.  I came to believe in God by my own investigation and conclusions.
And ultimately by my own choice.  Salvation, however, was granted only through
the grace of God.


To be a Christian is to model oneself after Jesus Christ as implied by the
very name Christian.  If you say you believe in your head but do not feel in
your heart, what does that say of your belief?


White supremists and Neo-Nazis are NOT any brand of Christian.

""If you hate your whom you can see then how can you love God whom you cannot
 see?""

What does this belief entail?  Believing in Christ and having your sins
forgiven in His name does NOT give a Christian a free licence to sin.  To
repent of a sin is to ask forgiveness of that sin and TRY NOT to do it
again.  I am a Christian, but if you lump me in with racists and accuse me
of being such, then are you not pre-judging me?  BTW, I am of Chinese racial
background and I know what it is to be part of a visible minority in this
country.  I don't think that I would be favourably looked upon by these
White supremist ""Christians"" as you call them.

Anyone can say what they believe, but if they don't practice what they preach,
then their belief is false.  Do you concur?
 

Nazis and racists in general are the ones that come to my immediate attention.
What I believe is that such people may be using the bible to mask their racial
intolerance and bigotry.  They can do as they do and hide behind Christianity
but I tell you that Jesus would have nothing to do with them.


No arguement there.


The only point I'm trying to make is that those who call themselves Christian
may not be Christian.  I ask that you draw your own conclusions by what they
do and what they say.  If they are not modelled after the example of Jesus
Christ then they are NOT Christian.  If they have not repented of their sins
and accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Saviour then they are 
NOT Christian.  These are the only criteria to being a Christian.

"Several people have enquired about the availability of the book about the
Great 72"" reflector built at Birr Castle, Ireland in 1845 which remained the
largest in the world until the the start of the 20th century.

""The Astronomy of Birr Castle"" was written by Patrick Moore who now sits on
the committee which is going to restore the telescope. (The remains are on
public display all year round - the massive support walls, the 60 foot long
tube, and other bits and pieces). This book is the definitivie history of
how one man, the Third Earl of Rosse, pulled off the most impressive
technical achievement, perhaps ever, in the history of the telescope, and
the discoveries made with the instrument.

Patrick Moore is donating all proceeds from the book's sale to help restore

					involved prior to that action;
					its called slander or libel
					(even where factually true butthen
					distoted or disseminated with intent
					to harm

	AgainI say:

		I do NOT know who did what

		The FBI leaders show moral SICKness trying to

		you may, in 22-5 years, find that the concept in our

How do you know? Were you there?

While obviously Koresh was a nut case, the (typical) inability of the
government/media to get its story straight is quite disturbing. On
tuesday night, NBC news reported that the FBI did not know the place
was burning down until they saw black smoke billowing from the
building. The next day, FBI agents were insisting that they saw Davidians
setting the fire. The FBI was also adamantly denying that it was possible
their battery of the compound's wallks could have accidentally set the
blaze, while also saying they hadnt been able to do much investigating
of the site because it was still too hot. So how did they KNOW they
didnt accidentally set the fire.

Sounds like the FBI just burned the place to the ground to destroy
evidence to me.

(I've seen satellites at midnight - they're not only in twilight.) :o) 


Now my comments: 

I'd like to add that some of the ""protests"" do not come from a strictly 
practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for 
research activities by professional astronomers.  Some of what I 
would complain about is rooted in aesthetics.  Many readers may 
never have known a time where the heavens were pristine - sacred - 
unsullied by the actions of humans.  The space between the stars 
as profoundly black as an abyss can be.  With full horizons and 
a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time 
- none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man. 
Any lights were supplied solely by nature; uncorruptable by men.  
Whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there 
and becoming immortal as the stars, whether by apotheosis or a belief 
in an afterlife.  

The Space Age changed all that.  The effect of the first Sputniks 
and Echo, etc. on this view could only happen once.  To see a light 
crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people 
is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating 
the scales involved is also awesome - even if the few hundreds or 
thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe.  
But there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky. 

Yes, I know aircraft are almost always in sight.  I have to live 
in a very populated area (6 miles from an international airport 
currently) where light pollution on the ground is ghastly.  The 
impact of humans is so extreme here - virtually no place exists 
that has not been shaped, sculpted, modified, trashed or whipped 
into shape by the hands of man.  In some places the only life 
forms larger than bacteria are humans, cockroaches, and squirrels 
(or rats).  I visited some friends up in the Appalacian mountains 
one weekend, ""getting away from it all"" (paved roads, indoor plumbing, 
malls, ...) and it felt good for a while - then I quickly noticed 
the hollow was directly under the main flight path into Dulles - 60-80 
miles to the east.  (Their 'security light' didn't help matters 
much either.)  But I've heard the artic wilderness gets lots of 
high air traffic.  So I know the skies are rarely perfect. 

But there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn't 
fouled in some way.  (I mean they've been TRYING this forever - 
like, concerning Tesla's idea to banish night, - wow!)  I don't watch 
commercial television, but I can imagine just how disgusting beer, 
truck, or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high.  
If ya' gotta make a buck on it (displaying products in heaven), at 
least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last
beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life.  

To be open about this though, I have here my listing of the passage 
of HST in the evening sky for this weekend - tonight Friday at 
8:25 p.m. EDT it will reach an altitude of 20.1 degrees on the 
local meridian from Baltimore vicinity.  I'll be trying to see it 
if I can - it _is_ my mealticket after all.  So I suppose I could 
be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky 
while complaining about billboards proposed by others.  Be that 
as it may, I think my point about a desire for beauty is valid, 
even if it can't ever be perfectly achieved. ",space

"Some time ago I sent the following message:
   Every once in a while I design an orbital space colony.  I'm gearing up to
   do another one.  I'd some info from you. If you were to move
   onto a space colony to live permanently, how big would the colony have
   to be for you to view a permanent move as desirable?  Specifically,

   How many people do you want to share the colony with?
 

   What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?  


   Assume 1g living (the colony will rotate).  Assume that you can leave
   from time to time for vacations and business trips.  If you're young
   enough, assume that you'll raise your children there.

I didn't get a lot of responses, and they were all over the block.
Thanx muchly to all those who responded, it is good food for thought.




Here's the (edited) responses I got:


   How many people do you want to share the colony with?
 
100

   What physical dimensions does the living are need to have?  

Cylinder 200m diameter x 1 km long

Rui Sousa
ruca@saber-si.pt

=============================================================================


100,000 - 250,000


100 square kms surface, divided into city, towns, villages and
countryside.  Must have lakes, rivers amd mountains.

=============================================================================

1000.  1000 people really isn't that large a number;
everyone will know everyone else within the space of a year, and will probably
be sick of everyone else within another year.


Hm.  I am not all that great at figuring it out.  But I would maximize the
percentage of colony-space that is accessible to humans.  Esecially if there
were to be children, since they will figure out how to go everywhere anyways.
And everyone, especially me, likes to ""go exploring""...I would want to be able
to go for a walk and see something different each time...

=============================================================================

For population, I think I would want a substantial town -- big enough
to have strangers in it.  This helps get away from the small-town
""everybody knows everything"" syndrome, which some people like but
I don't.  Call it several thousand people.

For physical dimensions, a somewhat similar criterion:  big enough
to contain surprises, at least until you spent considerable time
getting to know it.  As a more specific rule of thumb, big enough
for there to be places at least an hour away on foot.  Call that
5km, which means a 10km circumference if we're talking a sphere.

=============================================================================
My desires, for permanent move to a space colony, assuming easy communication
and travel:

Size:  About a small-town size, say 9 sq. km.  'Course, bigger is better :-)
Population:  about 100/sq km or less.  So, ~1000 for 9sqkm.  Less is
better for elbow room, more for interest and sanity, so say max 3000, min 300.

"[This is a co-authored report from two of us who were there.]

Gun Owners Action League, our state rifle association, started the day
with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at 9:30.
It was looking sparse (about 40 people) until the speaker began,
whereupon about 120 more people followed the loudspeakers from
wherever they had been lost, and filled out the area something proud.

Mike Yacino of GOAL spoke.  One of his best throwaway lines was to
remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been
checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state; while the
people in the Statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of
""election fraud"" to hold their jobs.

Nancy Snow and Amos Hamburger were busy handing out ID buttons and
sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings, and
telling people where to find their own representatives (and in too
many cases, who they were).

Mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and
discuss a bill that hadn't made it onto the official list.  It seems a
delegation of students from Simon's Rock of Bard College (alma mater
of Wayne Lo, who shot up the place with an SKS late last year) was
being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or
ammo to anyone who is not a state resident.

The hearings were originally scheduled in the (large) Gardner
Auditorium at 10:30, but that had been pre-empted by the Governor's
hearings on the Framingham Eight (women in prison for killing abusive
husbands, and seeking release).  So we had until 1:30 to buttonhole
our representatives, after which we would be squashed into an
inadequate hearing room.

One of my representatives' staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy.
He said, ""Oh, it must be gun hearings day again!  The gun lobby is
always so organized every year.""  I got a little pissed, and replied,
""I'm not from the gun lobby -- I'm from your district.""

At 12:30, your second reporter arrived in time to notice a
demonstration going on in front of the statehouse (where the
pro-gunners weren't).  Randy Price from the TV News was there, in his
mirror reflective shades, talking to one of the anti-gun types, and
several Simon's Rock anti-gun ""close-the-loophole"" protestors.
(Earlier, Randy had covered the GOAL rally.)

The room we had been assigned seated about 50.  Remember, there were
about 160 gun owners there, plus another 20-30 students and teachers
from Bard.  One of us had already reserved a seat; the other never got
closer than the atrium outside -- and there was a crowd behind HIM.  A
cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the
crowd from coming in.  Soon after the debate started, a loudspeaker
was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else.

Everyone who was there (inside and outside) got to sign up on a sheet
saying what their position was on which bills.  Most of us signed up
to ""support GOAL's position"" on ""all bills.""

First, because of their time constraints, public officials got to
testify.  And first up was the bill that nobody had seen (the students
had some curfew, I guess).  

Currently, Massachusetts law allows a non-resident to purchase long
guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of
his own state.  Previously, the law was similar, but applied only to
non-residents from states adjoining Massachusetts.  The Simon's Rock
folks called the current law a ""loophole"" and wanted it closed.

Two of their reps spoke about Wayne Lo and his ""SKS assault rifle.""
The second one, Hodgekiss, a co-sponsor, had done his homework so well
that he kept confusing Montana (Wayne Lo's home state) with Missouri,
and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery
corrected him after his second muff.  Carr, from Gloucester, claimed
that the new bill would put the law back the way it was, but he was
lying: the new bill allows purchases by non-residents of adjoining
states ONLY if they have licensing in their own state ""as strong as""
that in Massachusetts.  Since none of them do, that's that.

Some of the things these two said were really offensive.  ""In some of
these other states, anyone can buy a gun as long as he's breathing!""
(Oooooo!)  ""We have some very, very good gun laws in Massachusetts; if
only the other states would adopt the same type of laws, we wouldn't
be having this situation -- but they won't.""  (Naughty, naughty!)

Next up was Boston city councilman Albert ""Dapper"" O'Neill.  He was
there to testify pro-gun, but in some ways he was a liability.  He's
reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself, plus he's
almost a caricature of a law-n-order politician.  He badmouthed the
ACLU, said violent criminals should be executed, and that if he were
judge, he'd give arrestees their ""last rights"" (pun intended) on the
spot (at which many of the gun owners applauded, which bothered me.)
He said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the
right direction -- for the criminals.  He said this FOUR times :-(

Two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a
CCW or FID, and confiscate all your guns, if someone had filed a
restraining order against you.  (Note that the filing of a restraining
order requires no warrant, no hearing, no evidence, and no conviction
-- just an accusation.)  Senator Barrett of Reading testified in favor
of it, and patronized the pro-gunners there several times by saying,
""I'm sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to
get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have
convicted.""  I haven't seen such a disgustingly disingenuous
performance since Nixon whined that he wasn't a crook.

Barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the FID card renewable
every five years, instead of permanent as it is now.  The stated
purpose is to remove FID cards from those who have become ineligible.
""Revenue has nothing to do with it.""  (Yeah, right.)  Apparently, some
congressmen think we're stupid enough to swallow the argument that
it's preferable to process 1.6 million renewals every cycle in the
vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn
card away from a criminal at conviction time.  As usual, hassle the
law-abiding instead of the crook.

The two co-chairs of the committee were Rep. Caron and Sen. Jujuga.
Jujuga didn't say much (he was a co-sponsor of both ""restraining
order"" bills) but Caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn't let any
bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged.  (He 
was a co-sponsor of one of the ""restraining order"" bills as well.)  One
of the younger reps on the committee (forgot his name) was
vociferously pro-gun, somewhat embarrassingly so.  His heart was in
the right place, but his arguments seemed to be confined to, ""every
year it's the same damn thing, you come in here with this crap...""
It's nice to have a friend on the committee, but he could have been
more effective.

At about 3:00, it was clear that the hall-jam couldn't continue.
Someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because
the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting, so the loudspeaker was
disconnected.  So they found a bigger hall upstairs.  One of us had
to leave to catch his charter bus, and so missed the ""public""
testimony; the other got a seat this time.

Caron began by talking about how he got his FID 16 years ago, left the
state, and then returned without notifying them of his address change.
He complained that the state record system was not up-to-date and that
his PD back in his city of birth still thought he lived there.  Great
quote: ""If you purchase a gun today, it will not get into the state
computer system until 1999.""  (This was also an argument he used
against the renewable FID card.)

Testimony was heard from several ""battered women,"" one of whom had
been attacked by some guy in his 20's who had an FID card because he
got it when he was 15 or thereabouts.  They used a lot of emotion and
said how they were scared of these men.  A staffer of Attorney General
Harshbarger testified in favor of this anti-gun bill, saying how
50,000 restraining orders were granted last year, and how these women
needed to be protected.  Caron noted that a restraining order was
granted for 10 days, and then a hearing was held to determine whether
the order would be extended to a year.  He asked whether she would be
satisfied if the FID were revoked at the time of this hearing rather
than after the initial issuance of the FID.  She gave some long
rambling circumlocution in response.

Then testimony against the bill was heard.  Mike Yacino (who looks
something like Einstein) got up and made the point that restraining
orders were issued on too little evidence, that judges like to issue
restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they
think is right (man or woman), and that the hearings for restraining
orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts.
Atty. Karen McNutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony.

Other pro-gunners got up to testify.  One said he had had to file a
restraining order against a tenant to clear her out, and that she
countered by filing one against him!  He noted that this would have
allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law.
One of the junior reps noted that ""this is America"" and we have to be
certain that individual rights are respected.  Senator Jujuga
reiterated this, saying that ""people who abuse smaller people can go
to Hell as far as I care, but we have to be careful about equating
conviction with a restraining order.""  (Point and match, Senator.)

Another pro-gunner got up and testified that he didn't know his
citizenship ""expired every 5 years,"" and that a driver's license was a
privilege, not a right like the right to keep and bear arms.

A third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice
system, and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public
hangings.  Senator Jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death
penalty bill passed, and joking responded that he, too, favored public
hangings.  The speaker then responded, ""I'll make you a deal.  You get
me the rope, and I'll tie the noose.""

Next came public testimony on the Simon's Rock bill.  A teacher
testified that she had been the teacher of Wayne Lo, and that ""he
wouldn't have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was
outside"" without his evil gun.  She said that the ""loophole"" should be
closed to prevent something like this from ""ever happening again"".

Four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill, one of
spilling tears for the good legislators.  One of the students actually
shot by Wayne Lo was also there.  Many of them had T shirts on,
saying, ""As long as one person can buy a gun in anger, none of us are
safe -- support gun control.""  The committee was reluctant to grill or
correct the kids, except for Caron, who corrected one student who had
claimed that anyone could apply for an FID.  ""Only residents can get
FID's,"" he said.  (How much do you want to bet that this kid had no
idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut
out-of-staters completely off?)

Yacino and McNutt spoke again, this time noting that the bill as
written would affect both ammo AND ALL guns possessed by
out-of-staters.  Karen also noted that hunters in CT, NH, and VT could
be put away for a year if they wandered across the MA boundary
somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens.  Yacino
underscored the fact that Lo COULD have gotten an FID as a resident
student -- and, hell, even an CCW, as he had NO criminal or mental
record.

One junior rep was upset that it would take MA residents longer to buy
a gun than out-of-staters, and thought it was ""elitist"".  Another
(Caron?) said that we need the protection of preventing non-residents
from buying without an FID because only two other states in the union
had ""FID-type"" cards, so complying with all the laws of one's home
state was ""not enough.""  One pro-gun speaker replied that this
resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming,
""Everyone's out of step but Johnny!""

All the Bard College people were filing out as the pro-gun testimony
for this bill was made, and thus only pro-gunners were around when the
other bills came under consideration.  The main bills remaining (and
GOAL's position) were:

o  H.4375 and four others: Notify police chiefs so they can pull 
   licenses when a holder is convicted (strongly supported)

o  H.1732: Require trigger locks on all handguns sold (opposed)

o  H.962: Require trigger locks on all loaded firearms (strongly
   opposed)

o  H.1350: Allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws 
   (opposed)

o  H.1731: Fund bullet-proof vests for municipal police (supported)

o  S.1097: State Constitutional Amendment for the RKBA (supported)

o  Several on police discretion in the issuance of FID cards (opposed)

o  Several altering non-resident license conditions (supported)

o  H.1135: Ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state (guess!)

Some of these took only 30 seconds to consider, as the remaining
pro-gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them.

Mike Yacino noted that, besides the danger in screwing with a trigger
lock on a loaded gun, that bill would make it illegal for a licensee
to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked.

Caron blew right through H.1350 when he saw that we opposed it.
Again, he brought up the state's archaic records capability and said,
""This would create hundreds of different licensing systems.""

The session ran late -- since it was the last scheduled hearing, it
could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified.  It
ended at about 6:30.

Not particularly *in* the World Series. During the season, he was probably
more valuable than, say, putting Olerud out there to pitch, but yeah, he
*was* valuable in getting them there. In the postseason, he sucked dirty
canal water through a straw. The Jays won *in spite* of Morris much more
than *because of* him.


Umm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago,
where the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure
of better. The concept is called ""context"", and you should really become
familiar with it someday.


Unless this transaltes to ""Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with
a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to
the Jays,"" I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.


What on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has ""won"" 68% of
the games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17
wins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing
the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If
so, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris
allows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in
his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But
I forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance
to Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it
would have been a routine groundout, right?


Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to
you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the
accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that
a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your
continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to
any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have
spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.


No one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win
at least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the
World Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they
keep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they
traded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link
between Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man
was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs
out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,
gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.

Seriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference
between the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,
and why? Did Morris somehow ""learn how to win"" in the intervening ten years?
If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half
a run lower than 1992?

"The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to
death, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two
on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the
right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and
went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to
the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he
missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,
reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.

Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that
Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially
behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate
vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with
Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan
who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious
to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as
soon as he realized he had made the catch.

That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry
went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot
of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of
costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled
food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium
officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and
just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,
Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a
tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about 
winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made
the catch.

Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech
wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that
are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any 
that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have
been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility
of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he
is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated
his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is
impossible.

Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what
the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first
nine games.

I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull
hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,
he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.

But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities
of the fan.

In short: even if your deity *does* exist, that doesn't automatically
mean that I would worship it.  I am content to live my own life, and
fend for myself, so when I die, I can be proud of the fact that no
matter where I end up, it will be because of *my* actions and *my* choices.

If your god decides to toss me into a flaming pit for this, then so be
it.  I would much rather just cease to exist.  But if your god wants
my respect and my obedience, then it had better earn these; and if it
does, then they will be very strong and true.


Jesus wasn't the only one who rose from the dead -- I think it was
Osiris who did the same, as well as a few characters from Greek or
Norse legend, if memory serves.

But still: WHY would I want to rise from the dead?  Why do *you* want to?


If your god wants to win my devotion, then it knows what it can do --
provide some way for me to believe without having to resort to blind
faith that could be applied equally well to any religion.


That's precisely it.  I neither see nor know Zeus either, nor Odin.
Shall I offer them the same devotion I offer Jesus?


You've got to understand my point-of-view: I see Christians spouting
Bible verse all the time as if it were some sort of magic spell that
will level all opposition.  Truth is, it's not.  Robert has never
demonstrated that he actually understands what the verses imply; he
just rattles them off day by day.  Some brazenly fly in the face of
common sense and reality, and I point these out where I can.

But even more than that, even when Christians *do* try to explain the
verses in their own words, they do so from a Christian point of view,
which is that every human being would want to be a Christian if only
he or she understood the Christian message properly, and then all
strife and suffering on the earth would end.  Here's the problem with
that: substitute ""Moslem"" or ""Buddhist"" or ""Satanist"" instead of
""Christian"", and it means the same thing.

Christanity is a very nice belief set around a very nice book.  But if
you want to make me believe that it has any bearing on the REAL WORLD,
you've got some convincing to do.


And in my opinion, you're bumbling about blindly making up entities
where there aren't any, and depriving yourself of a true understanding
and enjoyment of your life.  As long as you keep your beliefs to
yourself, I'll keep my beliefs to myself -- but as soon as you start
waving them around, expect me to toss in my opinions, too.",religion
"



Foolish me.  And here I thought it had something to do with the 
fact that they were hitting against Wakefield, who had no ""kncukle""
to his ball that day, and Otto, who has no stuff.  I wonder if 
Reggie gave the same pep talk and instruction to the rest of the
lineup, who also suddenly came alive those two games.

----------


[1]  What is JPEG?

JPEG (pronounced ""jay-peg"") is a standardized image compression mechanism.
JPEG stands for Joint Photographic Experts Group, the original name of the
committee that wrote the standard.  JPEG is designed for compressing either
full-color or gray-scale digital images of ""natural"", real-world scenes.
It does not work so well on non-realistic images, such as cartoons or line
drawings.

JPEG does not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) images, nor does it
handle motion picture compression.  Standards for compressing those types
of images are being worked on by other committees, named JBIG and MPEG
respectively.

JPEG is ""lossy"", meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn't
quite identical to what you originally put in.  The algorithm achieves much
of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye, notably
the fact that small color details aren't perceived as well as small details
of light-and-dark.  Thus, JPEG is intended for compressing images that will
be looked at by humans.  If you plan to machine-analyze your images, the
small errors introduced by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are
invisible to the eye.

A useful property of JPEG is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by
adjusting compression parameters.  This means that the image maker can trade
off file size against output image quality.  You can make *extremely* small
files if you don't mind poor quality; this is useful for indexing image
archives, making thumbnail views or icons, etc. etc.  Conversely, if you
aren't happy with the output quality at the default compression setting, you
can jack up the quality until you are satisfied, and accept lesser compression.


[2]  Why use JPEG?

There are two good reasons: to make your image files smaller, and to store
24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.

Making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across
networks and for archiving libraries of images.  Being able to compress a
2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbytes or so makes a big difference in
disk space and transmission time!  (If you are comparing GIF and JPEG, the
size ratio is more like four to one.  More details below.)

If your viewing software doesn't support JPEG directly, you'll have to
convert JPEG to some other format for viewing or manipulating images.  Even
with a JPEG-capable viewer, it takes longer to decode and view a JPEG image
than to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thus, using
JPEG is essentially a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to
store or transmit an image more cheaply.

It's worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved, the
time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the
extra time to decompress the file.  I'll let you do the arithmetic yourself.

The other reason why JPEG will gradually replace GIF as a standard Usenet
posting format is that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bits/pixel
(16 million colors) instead of 8 or less (256 or fewer colors).  If you have
only 8-bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage
to you.  Within a couple of years, though, 8-bit GIF will look as obsolete as
black-and-white MacPaint format does today.  Furthermore, for reasons detailed
in section 7, JPEG is far more useful than GIF for exchanging images among
people with widely varying color display hardware.  Hence JPEG is considerably
more appropriate than GIF for use as a Usenet posting standard.


[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?

JPEG is *not* going to displace GIF entirely; for some types of images,
GIF is superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first
things to learn about JPEG is which kinds of images to apply it to.

As a rule of thumb, JPEG is superior to GIF for storing full-color or
gray-scale images of ""realistic"" scenes; that means scanned photographs and
similar material.  JPEG is superior even if you don't have 24-bit display
hardware, and it is a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for details.)

GIF does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors,
such as cartoons and line drawings.  In particular, large areas of pixels
that are all *exactly* the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed
by GIF.  JPEG can't squeeze these files as much as GIF does without
introducing visible defects.  This sort of image is best kept in GIF form.
(In particular, single-color borders are quite cheap in GIF files, but they
should be avoided in JPEG files.)

JPEG also has a hard time with very sharp edges: a row of pure-black pixels
adjacent to a row of pure-white pixels, for example.  Sharp edges tend to
come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting.  Again, this
sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs, but it shows up fairly
often in GIF files: borders, overlaid text, etc.  The blurriness is
particularly objectionable with text that's only a few pixels high.
If you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don't JPEG it.

Computer-drawn images (ray-traced scenes, for instance) usually fall between
scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity.  The more complex and
subtly rendered the image, the more likely that JPEG will do well on it.
The same goes for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawings and such).

Plain black-and-white (two level) images should never be converted to JPEG.
You need at least about 16 gray levels before JPEG is useful for gray-scale
images.  It should also be noted that GIF is lossless for gray-scale images
of up to 256 levels, while JPEG is not.

If you have an existing library of GIF images, you may wonder whether you
should convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.
(Section 7, which argues that JPEG image quality is superior to GIF, only
applies if both formats start from a full-color original.  If you start from
a GIF, you've already irretrievably lost a great deal of information; JPEG
can only make things worse.)  However, the disk space savings may justify
converting anyway.  This is a decision you'll have to make for yourself.
If you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hints.  Be
prepared to leave some images in GIF format, since some GIFs will not
convert well.


[4]  How well does JPEG compress images?

Pretty darn well.  Here are some sample file sizes for an image I have
handy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three
files are for comparison purposes; the rest were created with the free JPEG
software described in section 6B.

File	   Size in bytes		Comments

ship.ppm	1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bits
			 or 3 bytes per pixel, plus a few bytes overhead)
ship.ppm.Z	 963829  PPM file passed through Unix compress
			 compress doesn't accomplish a lot, you'll note.
			 Other text-oriented compressors give similar results.
ship.gif	 240438  Converted to GIF with ppmquant -fs 256 | ppmtogif
			 Most of the savings is the result of losing color
			 info: GIF saves 8 bits/pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)

ship.jpg95	 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality setting)
			 This is indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,
			 at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs.
ship.jpg75	  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default setting)
			 You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this
			 from the original, even with both on-screen at once.
ship.jpg50	  38406  cjpeg -Q 50
			 This has slight defects; if you know what to look
			 for, you could tell it's been JPEGed without seeing
			 the original.  Still as good image quality as many
			 recent postings in Usenet pictures groups.
ship.jpg25	  25192  cjpeg -Q 25
			 JPEG's characteristic ""blockiness"" becomes apparent
			 at this setting (djpeg -blocksmooth helps some).
			 Still, I've seen plenty of Usenet postings that were
			 of poorer image quality than this.
ship.jpg5o	   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cuts table overhead)
			 Blocky, but perfectly satisfactory for preview or
			 indexing purposes.  Note that this file is TINY:
			 the compression ratio from the original is 173:1 !

In this case JPEG can make a file that's a factor of four or five smaller
than a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file is every bit as good as the
GIF, better if you have a full-color display).  This seems to be a typical
ratio for real-world scenes.


[5]  What are good ""quality"" settings for JPEG?

Most JPEG compressors let you pick a file size vs. image quality tradeoff by
selecting a quality setting.  There seems to be widespread confusion about
the meaning of these settings.  ""Quality 95"" does NOT mean ""keep 95% of the
information"", as some have claimed.  The quality scale is purely arbitrary;
it's not a percentage of anything.

The name of the game in using JPEG is to pick the lowest quality setting
(smallest file size) that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from
the original.  This setting will vary from one image to another and from one
observer to another, but here are some rules of thumb.

The default quality setting (-Q 75) is very often the best choice.  This
setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a
typical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defects, then go up.  Except for
experimental purposes, never go above -Q 95; saying -Q 100 will produce a
file two or three times as large as -Q 95, but of hardly any better quality.

If the image was less than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to
go down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you
might need to go to a HIGHER quality setting to avoid further degradation.
The second case seems to apply much of the time when converting GIFs to JPEG.
The default -Q 75 is about right for compressing 24-bit images, but -Q 85 to
95 is usually better for converting GIFs (see section 14 for more info).

If you want a very small file (say for preview or indexing purposes) and are
prepared to tolerate large defects, a -Q setting in the range of 5 to 10 is
about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amusing as ""op art"".

(Note: the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free JPEG
software described in section 6B, and to many programs based on it.  Other
JPEG implementations, such as Image Alchemy, may use a completely different
quality scale.  Some programs don't even provide a numeric scale, just
""high""/""medium""/""low""-style choices.)


[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?

Most of the programs described in this section are available by FTP.
If you don't know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article ""How to find sources"".
(If you don't have direct access to FTP, read about ftpmail servers in the
same article.)  That article appears regularly in news.answers, or you can
get it by sending e-mail to mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu with
""send usenet/news.answers/finding-sources"" in the body.  The ""Anonymous FTP
List FAQ"" may also be helpful --- it's usenet/news.answers/ftp-list/faq in
the news.answers archive.

NOTE: this list changes constantly.  If you have a copy more than a couple
months old, get the latest JPEG FAQ from the news.answers archive.


[6A]  If you are looking for ""canned"" software, viewers, etc:

The first part of this list is system-specific programs that only run on one
kind of system.  If you don't see what you want for your machine, check out
the portable JPEG software described at the end of the list.  Note that this
list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over
Internet; but some commercial programs are listed too.

X Windows:

John Bradley's free XV (version 2.00 and up) is an excellent viewer for JPEG,
GIF, and other image formats.  It's available for FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu
or ftp.cis.upenn.edu.  The file is called 'xv-???.tar.Z' (where ??? is the
version number, currently 2.21); it is located in the 'contrib' directory on
export or the 'pub/xv' directory at upenn.  XV reduces all images to 8 bits
internally, which means it's not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit
display (you'll still get only 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn't use XV to
convert full-color images to JPEG, because they'll get color-quantized first.
But XV is a fine tool for converting GIF and other 8-bit images to JPEG.
CAUTION: there is a glitch in versions 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check
the ""save at normal size"" checkbox when saving a JPEG file, or the file will
be blurry.

Another good choice for X Windows is John Cristy's free ImageMagick package,
also available from export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.
This package handles many image processing and conversion tasks.  The
ImageMagick viewer handles 24-bit displays correctly; for colormapped
displays, it does better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the
basic free JPEG software.

Both of the above are large, complex packages.  If you just want a simple
image viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage supports JPEG in its latest
release, 3.03.  xloadimage is free and available from export.lcs.mit.edu,
file contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli is a variant version of xloadimage,
said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.
(The current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current
xloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG files, because it has the IJG v4
decoder while xloadimage 3.03 is using a hacked-over v1.  The next
xloadimage release will fix this.)  xli is also free and available from
export.lcs.mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both programs are said
to do the right thing with 24-bit displays.


MS-DOS:

This covers plain DOS; for Windows or OS/2 programs, see the next headings.

One good choice is Eric Praetzel's free DVPEG, which views JPEG and GIF files.
The current version, 2.4a, is available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca
(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewers/dvpeg24a.zip.  This is a good basic
viewer that works on either 286 or 386/486 machines.  The user interface is
not flashy, but it's functional.

Another freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer is Mohammad Rezaei's Hiview.  The
current version, 1.2, is available from Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
below), file msdos/graphics/hv12.zip.  Hiview requires a 386 or better CPU
and a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Windows and
OS/2 do not).  Hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no
bigger than your screen.  For larger images, it scales the image down to fit
on the screen (rather than using panning/scrolling as most viewers do).
You may or may not prefer this approach, but there's no denying that it
slows down loading of large images considerably.  Note: installation is a
bit tricky; read the directions carefully!

A shareware alternative is ColorView for DOS ($30).  This is easier to
install than either of the two freeware alternatives.  Its user interface is
also much spiffier-looking, although personally I find it harder to use ---
more keystrokes, inconsistent behavior.  It is faster than DVPEG but a
little slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For images larger than
screen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same speed, and both
are faster than Hiview.)  The current version is 2.1, available from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/dcview21.zip.
Requires a VESA graphics driver; if you don't have one, look in vesadrv2.zip
or vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PCs have a built-in
VESA driver, so don't try to load a VESA driver unless ColorView complains
that the driver is missing.)

A second shareware alternative is Fullview, which has been kicking around
the net for a while, but I don't know any stable archive location for it.
The current (rather old) version is inferior to the above viewers anyway.
The author tells me that a new version of Fullview will be out shortly
and it will be submitted to the Simtel20 archives at that time.

The well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) supports JPEG in its latest
revision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW's JPEG implementation isn't very good:
it's slow (about half the speed of the above viewers) and image quality is
poor except on hi-color displays.  Too bad ... it'd have been nice to see a
good JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/gif/cshw860a.zip.

Due to the remarkable variety of PC graphics hardware, any one of these
viewers might not work on your particular machine.  If you can't get *any*
of them to work, you'll need to use one of the following conversion programs
to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you
have hi-color hardware, don't use GIF as the intermediate format; try to
find a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 is reputed to do the right
thing with hi-color displays.)

The Independent JPEG Group's free JPEG converters are FTPable from Simtel20
and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/jpeg4.zip (or
jpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extended memory).  These files are DOS
compilations of the free source code described in section 6B; they will
convert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM formats.

Handmade Software offers free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tools, GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.
These are slow and are limited to conversion to and from GIF format; in
particular, you can't get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major
advantage of these tools is that they will read and write HSI's proprietary
JPEG format as well as the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Since HSI-format
files are rather widespread on BBSes, this is a useful capability.  Version
2.0 of these tools is free (prior versions were shareware).  Get it from
Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/gif2jpg2.zip.
NOTE: do not use HSI format for files to be posted on Internet, since it is
not readable on non-PC platforms.

Handmade Software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation
package, Image Alchemy.  This will translate JPEG files (both JFIF and HSI
formats) to and from many other image formats.  It can also display images.
A demo version of Image Alchemy version 1.6.1 is available from Simtel20 and
mirror sites (see NOTE below), file msdos/graphics/alch161.zip.

NOTE ABOUT SIMTEL20: The Internet's key archive site for PC-related programs
is Simtel20, full name wsmr-simtel20.army.mil (192.88.110.20).  Simtel20
runs a non-Unix system with weird directory names; where this document
refers to directory (eg) ""msdos/graphics"" at Simtel20, that really means
""pd1:<msdos.graphics>"".  If you are not physically on MILnet, you should
expect rather slow FTP transfer rates from Simtel20.  There are several
Internet sites that maintain copies (mirrors) of the Simtel20 archives;
most FTP users should go to one of the mirror sites instead.  A popular USA
mirror site is oak.oakland.edu (141.210.10.117), which keeps Simtel20 files
in (eg) ""/pub/msdos/graphics"".  If you have no FTP capability, you can
retrieve files from Simtel20 by e-mail; see informational postings in
comp.archives.msdos.announce to find out how.  If you are outside the USA,
consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest Simtel20 mirror is.

Microsoft Windows:

There are several Windows programs capable of displaying JPEG images.
(Windows viewers are generally slower than DOS viewers on the same hardware,
due to Windows' system overhead.  Note that you can run the DOS conversion
programs described above inside a Windows DOS window.)

The newest entry is WinECJ, which is free and EXTREMELY fast.  Version 1.0
is available from ftp.rahul.net, file /pub/bryanw/pc/jpeg/wecj.zip.
Requires Windows 3.1 and 256-or-more-colors mode.  This is a no-frills
viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it
decodes; and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers.
But it's so fast you'll use it anyway, at least for previewing...

JView is freeware, fairly fast, has good on-line help, and can write out the
decompressed image in Windows BMP format; but it can't create new JPEG
files, and it doesn't view GIFs.  JView also lacks some other useful
features of the shareware viewers (such as brightness adjustment), but it's
an excellent basic viewer.  The current version, 0.9, is available from
ftp.cica.indiana.edu (129.79.20.84), file pub/pc/win3/desktop/jview090.zip.
(Mirrors of this archive can be found at some other Internet sites,
including wuarchive.wustl.edu.)

WinJPEG (shareware, $20) displays JPEG,GIF,Targa,TIFF, and BMP image files;
it can write all of these formats too, so it can be used as a converter.
It has some other nifty features including color-balance adjustment and
slideshow.  The current version is 2.1, available from Simtel20 and mirror
sites (see NOTE above), file msdos/windows3/winjp210.zip.  (This is a slow
286-compatible version; if you register, you'll get the 386-only version,
which is roughly 25% faster.)

ColorView is another shareware entry ($30).  This was an early and promising
contender, but it has not been updated in some time, and at this point it
has no real advantages over WinJPEG.  If you want to try it anyway, the
current version is 0.97, available from ftp.cica.indiana.edu, file
pub/pc/win3/desktop/cview097.zip.  (I understand that a new version will
be appearing once the authors are finished with ColorView for DOS.)

DVPEG (see DOS heading) also works under Windows, but only in full-screen
mode, not in a window.

OS/2:

The following files are available from hobbes.nmsu.edu (128.123.35.151).
Note: check /pub/uploads for more recent versions --- the hobbes moderator
is not very fast about moving uploads into their permanent directories.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/jpegv4.zip
    32-bit version of free IJG conversion programs, version 4.
/pub/os2/all/graphics/jpeg4-16.zip
    16-bit version of same, for OS/2 1.x.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/imgarc11.zip
    Image Archiver 1.01: image conversion/viewing with PM graphical interface.
    Strong on conversion functions, viewing is a bit weaker.  Shareware, $15.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmjpeg11.zip
    PMJPEG 1.1: OS/2 2.x port of WinJPEG, a popular viewer for Windows
    (see description in Windows section).  Shareware, $20.
/pub/os2/2.x/graphics/pmview84.zip
    PMView 0.84: JPEG/GIF/BMP viewer.  GIF viewing very fast, JPEG viewing
    fast if you have huge amounts of RAM, otherwise about the same speed
    as the above programs.  Strong 24-bit display support.  Shareware, $20.

Macintosh:

Most Mac JPEG programs rely on Apple's JPEG implementation, which is part of
the QuickTime system extension; so you need to have QuickTime installed.
To use QuickTime, you need a 68020 or better CPU and you need to be running
System 6.0.7 or later.  (If you're running System 6, you must also install
the 32-bit QuickDraw extension; this is built-in on System 7.)  You can get
QuickTime by FTP from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/quicktime.hqx.
(As of 11/92, this file contains QuickTime 1.5, which is better than QT 1.0
in several ways.  With respect to JPEG, it is marginally faster and
considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt JPEG file.  However,
some applications seem to have compatibility problems with QT 1.5.)

Mac users should keep in mind that QuickTime's JPEG format, PICT/JPEG, is
not the same as the Usenet-standard JFIF JPEG format.  (See section 10 for
details.)  If you post images on Usenet, make sure they are in JFIF format.
Most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format.

The first choice is probably JPEGView, a free program for viewing images
that are in JFIF format, PICT/JPEG format, or GIF format.  It also can
convert between the two JPEG formats.  The current version, 2.0, is a big
improvement over prior versions.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu
(36.44.0.6), file /info-mac/app/jpeg-view-20.hqx.  Requires System 7 and
QuickTime.  On 8-bit displays, JPEGView usually produces the best color
image quality of all the currently available Mac JPEG viewers.  JPEGView can
view large images in much less memory than other Mac viewers; in fact, it's
the only one that can deal with JPEG images much over 640x480 pixels on a
typical 4MB Mac.  Given a large image, JPEGView automatically scales it down
to fit on the screen, rather than presenting scroll bars like most other
viewers.  (You can zoom in on any desired portion, though.)  Some people
like this behavior, some don't.  Overall, JPEGView's user interface is very
well thought out.

GIFConverter, a shareware ($40) image viewer/converter, supports JFIF and
PICT/JPEG, as well as GIF and several other image formats.  The latest
version is 2.3.2.  Get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/art/gif/gif-converter-232.hqx.  Requires System 6.0.5 or later.
GIFConverter is not better than JPEGView as a plain JPEG/GIF viewer, but
it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion
capabilities, so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of
playing around with images.  Also, the newest version of GIFConverter can
load and save JFIF images *without* QuickTime, so it is your best bet if
your machine is too old to run QuickTime.  (But it's faster with QuickTime.)
Note: If GIFConverter runs out of memory trying to load a large JPEG, try
converting the file to GIF with JPEG Convert, then viewing the GIF version.

JPEG Convert, a Mac version of the free IJG JPEG conversion utilities, is
available from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file /info-mac/app/jpeg-convert-10.hqx.
This will run on any Mac, but it only does file conversion, not viewing.
You can use it in conjunction with any GIF viewer.

Previous versions of this FAQ recommended Imagery JPEG v0.6, a JPEG<=>GIF
converter based on an old version of the IJG code.  If you are using this
program, you definitely should replace it with JPEG Convert.

Apple's free program PictPixie can view images in JFIF, QuickTime JPEG, and
GIF format, and can convert between these formats.  You can get PictPixie
from ftp.apple.com, file dts/mac/quicktime/qt.1.0.stuff/pictpixie.hqx.
Requires QuickTime.  PictPixie was intended as a developer's tool, and it's
really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with QuickTime.
Some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory, it produces
relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a 24-bit display,
and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface.  Worse, PictPixie is an
unsupported program, meaning it has some minor bugs that Apple does not
intend to fix.  (There is an old version of PictPixie, called
PICTCompressor, floating around the net.  If you have this you should trash
it, as it's even buggier.  Also, the QuickTime Starter Kit includes a much
cleaned-up descendant of PictPixie called Picture Compressor.  Note that
Picture Compressor is NOT free and may not be distributed on the net.)

Storm Technology's Picture Decompress is a free JPEG viewer/converter.
This rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways, but
it will run without System 7 or QuickTime, so you may be forced to use it on
older systems.  (It does need 32-bit QuickDraw, so really old machines can't
use it.)  You can get it from sumex-aim.stanford.edu, file
/info-mac/app/picture-decompress-201.hqx.  You must set the file type of a
downloaded image file to 'JPEG' to allow Picture Decompress to open it.

If your machine is too old to run 32-bit QuickDraw (a Mac Plus for instance),
GIFConverter is your only choice for single-program JPEG viewing.  If you
don't want to pay for GIFConverter, use JPEG Convert and a free GIF viewer.

More and more commercial Mac applications are supporting JPEG, although not
all can deal with the Usenet-standard JFIF format.  Adobe Photoshop, version
2.0.1 or later, can read and write JFIF-format JPEG files (use the JPEG
plug-in from the Acquire menu).  You must set the file type of a downloaded
JPEG file to 'JPEG' to allow Photoshop to recognize it.

Amiga:

(Most programs listed in this section are stored in the AmiNet archive at
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (130.60.80.80).  There are many mirror sites of this
archive and you should try to use the closest one.  In the USA, a good
choice is wuarchive.wustl.edu; look under /mirrors/amiga.physik.unizh.ch/...)

HamLab Plus is an excellent JPEG viewer/converter, as well as being a
general image manipulation tool.  It's cheap (shareware, $20) and can read
several formats besides JPEG.  The current version is 2.0.8.  A demo version
is available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/edit/hamlab208d.lha.  The demo version will crop images larger
than 512x512, but it is otherwise fully functional.

Rend24 (shareware, $30) is an image renderer that can display JPEG, ILBM,
and GIF images.  The program can be used to create animations, even
capturing frames on-the-fly from rendering packages like Lightwave.  The
current version is 1.05, available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror
sites), file amiga/os30/gfx/rend105.lha.  (Note: although this directory is
supposedly for AmigaDOS 3.0 programs, the program will also run under
AmigaDOS 1.3, 2.04 or 2.1.)

Viewtek is a free JPEG/ILBM/GIF/ANIM viewer.  The current version is 1.04,
available from amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites), file
amiga/gfx/show/ViewTek104.lha.

If you're willing to spend real money, there are several commercial packages
that support JPEG.  Two are written by Thomas Krehbiel, the author of Rend24
and Viewtek.  These are CineMorph, a standalone image morphing package, and
ImageFX, an impressive 24-bit image capture, conversion, editing, painting,
effects and prepress package that also includes CineMorph.  Both are
distributed by Great Valley Products.  Art Department Professional (ADPro),
from ASDG Inc, is the most widely used commercial image manipulation
software for Amigas.  ImageMaster, from Black Belt Systems, is another
well-regarded commercial graphics package with JPEG support.

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Amigas from
amiga.physik.unizh.ch (and mirror sites) in directory amiga/gfx/conv, file
AmigaJPEGV4.lha.  These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM,GIF,Targa formats.

The Amiga world is heavily infested with quick-and-dirty JPEG programs, many
based on an ancient beta-test version of the free IJG JPEG software (thanks
to a certain magazine that published same on its disk-of-the-month, without
so much as notifying the authors).  Among these are ""AugJPEG"", ""NewAmyJPEG"",
""VJPEG"", and probably others I have not even heard of.  In my opinion,
anything older than IJG version 3 (March 1992) is not worth the disk space
it's stored on; if you have such a program, trash it and get something newer.

Atari ST:

The free IJG JPEG software is available compiled for Atari ST, TT, etc,
from atari.archive.umich.edu, file /atari/Graphics/jpeg4bin.zoo.
These programs convert JPEG to/from PPM, GIF, Targa formats.

I have not heard of any free or shareware JPEG-capable viewer for Ataris,
but surely there must be one by now?  Pointers appreciated.

Acorn Archimedes:

!ChangeFSI, supplied with RISC OS 3 version 3.10, can convert from and view
JPEG JFIF format.  Provision is also made to convert images to JPEG,
although this must be done from the CLI rather than by double-clicking.

Recent versions (since 7.11) of the shareware program Translator can handle
JPEG, along with about 30 other image formats.  While older versions can be
found on some Archimedes bboards, the current version is only available by
registering with the author, John Kortink, Nutterbrink 31, 7544 WJ, Enschede,
The Netherlands.  Price 35 Dutch guilders (about $22 or 10 pounds).

There's also a commercial product called !JPEG which provides JPEG read/write
functionality and direct JPEG viewing, as well as a host of other image
format conversion and processing options.  This is more expensive but not
necessarily better than the above programs.  Contact: DT Software, FREEPOST,
Cambridge, UK.  Tel: 0223 841099.


Portable software for almost any system:

If none of the above fits your situation, you can obtain and compile the free
JPEG conversion software described in 6B.  You'll also need a viewer program.
If your display is 8 bits or less, any GIF viewer will do fine; if you have a
display with more color capability, try to find a viewer that can read Targa
or PPM 24-bit image files.

There are numerous commercial JPEG offerings, with more popping up every
day.  I recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find
the available free or shareware software vastly too slow.  In that case,
purchase a hardware-assisted product.  Ask pointed questions about whether
the product complies with the final JPEG standard and about whether it can
handle the JFIF file format; many of the earliest commercial releases are
not and never will be compatible with anyone else's files.


[6B]  If you are looking for source code to work with:

Free, portable C code for JPEG compression is available from the Independent
JPEG Group, which I lead.  A package containing our source code,
documentation, and some small test files is available from several places.
The ""official"" archive site for this source code is ftp.uu.net (137.39.1.9
or 192.48.96.9).  Look under directory /graphics/jpeg; the current release
is jpegsrc.v4.tar.Z.  (This is a compressed TAR file; don't forget to
retrieve in binary mode.)  You can retrieve this file by FTP or UUCP.
If you are on a PC and don't know how to cope with .tar.Z format, you may
prefer ZIP format, which you can find at Simtel20 and mirror sites (see NOTE
above), file msdos/graphics/jpegsrc4.zip.  This file will also be available on
CompuServe, in the GRAPHSUPPORT forum (GO PICS), library 15, as jpsrc4.zip.
If you have no FTP access, you can retrieve the source from your nearest
comp.sources.misc archive; version 4 appeared as issues 55-72 of volume 34.
(If you don't know how to retrieve comp.sources.misc postings, see the FAQ
article ""How to find sources"", referred to at the top of section 6.)

The free JPEG code provides conversion between JPEG ""JFIF"" format and image
files in GIF, PBMPLUS PPM/PGM, Utah RLE, and Truevision Targa file formats.
The core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other
programs, such as image viewers.  The package is highly portable; we have
tested it on many machines ranging from PCs to Crays.

We have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use.
Companies are welcome to use it as the basis for JPEG-related products.
We do not ask a royalty, although we do ask for an acknowledgement in
product literature (see the README file in the distribution for details).
We hope to make this software industrial-quality --- although, as with
anything that's free, we offer no warranty and accept no liability.

The Independent JPEG Group is a volunteer organization; if you'd like to
contribute to improving our software, you are welcome to join.


[7]  What's all this hoopla about color quantization?

Most people don't have full-color (24 bit per pixel) display hardware.
Typical display hardware stores 8 or fewer bits per pixel, so it can display
256 or fewer distinct colors at a time.  To display a full-color image, the
computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative
colors.  This process is called ""color quantization"".  (This is something
of a misnomer, ""color selection"" would be a better term.  We're stuck with
the standard usage though.)

Clearly, color quantization is a lossy process.  It turns out that for most
images, the details of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact
on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by JPEG (except at
the very lowest JPEG quality settings).

Since JPEG is a full-color format, converting a color JPEG image for display
on 8-bit-or-less hardware requires color quantization.  This is true for
*all* color JPEGs: even if you feed a 256-or-less-color GIF into JPEG, what
comes out of the decompressor is *not* 256 colors, but thousands of colors.
This happens because JPEG's lossiness affects each pixel a little
differently, so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably
come out with slightly different colors.  Each original color gets ""smeared""
into a group of nearby colors.  Therefore quantization is always required to
display a color JPEG on a colormapped display, regardless of the image
source.  The only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray-scale output.

(Incidentally, because of this effect it's nearly meaningless to talk about
the number of colors used by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempted to count
the number of distinct pixel values, different JPEG decoders would give you
different results because of roundoff error differences.  I occasionally see
posted images described as ""256-color JPEG"".  This tells me that the poster
(a) hasn't read this FAQ and (b) probably converted the JPEG from a GIF.
JPEGs can be classified as color or gray-scale (just like photographs), but
number of colors just isn't a useful concept for JPEG.)

On the other hand, a GIF image by definition has already been quantized to
256 or fewer colors.  (A GIF *does* have a definite number of colors in its
palette, and the format doesn't allow more than 256 palette entries.)
For purposes of Usenet picture distribution, GIF has the advantage that the
sender precomputes the color quantization, so recipients don't have to.
This is also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you're stuck with the sender's
quantization.  If the sender quantized to a different number of colors than
what you can display, you have to re-quantize, resulting in much poorer
image quality than if you had quantized once from a full-color image.
Furthermore, if the sender didn't use a high-quality color quantization
algorithm, you're out of luck.

For this reason, JPEG offers the promise of significantly better image quality
for all users whose machines don't match the sender's display hardware.
JPEG's full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user's display
hardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future
improvements in quantization algorithms (there is a lot of active research in
this area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG
images you already have.  With a GIF, you're stuck forevermore with what was
sent.

It's also worth mentioning that many GIF-viewing programs include rather
shoddy quantization routines.  If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA
display, for example, you are probably getting a much worse image than you
need to.  This is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color
quantizations (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it's
also due to sloppiness.  JPEG conversion programs will be forced to use
high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all, and in
normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be
displayed.  Thus, JPEG is likely to provide better results than the average
GIF program for low-color-resolution displays as well as high-resolution ones!

Finally, an ever-growing number of people have better-than-8-bit display
hardware already: 15-bit ""hi-color"" PC displays, true 24-bit displays on
workstations and Macintoshes, etc.  For these people, GIF is already
obsolete, as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their
display.  JPEG images can drive these displays much more effectively.
Thus, JPEG is an all-around better choice than GIF for representing images
in a machine-independent fashion.


[8]  How does JPEG work?

The buzz-words to know are chrominance subsampling, discrete cosine
transforms, coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy
coding.  This article's long enough already, so I'm not going to say more
than that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.
This is available from the news.answers archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in files
/pub/usenet/news.answers/compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you need help in
using the news.answers archive, see the top of this article.


[9]  What about lossless JPEG?

There's a great deal of confusion on this subject.  The JPEG committee did
define a truly lossless compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantees the
final output is bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, this
lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular, lossy JPEG
algorithm, and it offers much less compression.  At present, very few
implementations of lossless JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.

Saying ""-Q 100"" to the free JPEG software DOES NOT get you a lossless image.
What it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient
quantization step.  There is still a good deal of information loss in the
color subsampling step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say
""-sample 1x1"" to turn off subsampling.  Keep in mind that many commercial
JPEG implementations cannot cope with the resulting file.)

Even with both quantization and subsampling turned off, the regular JPEG
algorithm is not lossless, because it is subject to roundoff errors in
various calculations.  The maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel
value; it's highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye,
but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image.

At this minimum-loss setting, regular JPEG produces files that are perhaps
half the size of an uncompressed 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossless JPEG
provides roughly the same amount of compression, but it guarantees
bit-for-bit accuracy.

If you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less
than 6 bits per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the
JBIG bilevel image compression standard.  This performs better than JPEG
lossless on such images.  JPEG lossless is superior to JBIG on images with
6 or more bits per pixel; furthermore, JPEG is public domain (at least with a
Huffman back end), while the JBIG techniques are heavily covered by patents.


[10]  Why all the argument about file formats?

Strictly speaking, JPEG refers only to a family of compression algorithms;
it does *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee was
prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international
standards organizations.

Since we can't actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on
a common file format, this leaves us with a problem.  In the absence of
official standards, a number of JPEG program writers have just gone off to
""do their own thing"", and as a result their programs aren't compatible with
anybody else's.

The closest thing we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format is some work
that's been coordinated by people at C-Cube Microsystems.  They have defined
two JPEG-based file formats:
  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a ""low-end"" format that transports
    pixels and not much else.
  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldus TIFF format.  TIFF is
    a ""high-end"" format that will let you record just about everything you
    ever wanted to know about an image, and a lot more besides :-).  TIFF is
    a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove less transportable,
    because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different
    and incompatible subsets of TIFF.  It's not likely that adding JPEG to the
    mix will do anything to improve this situation.
Both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors
of JPEG-related products; it's reasonably likely that future commercial
products will adhere to one or both standards.

I believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF as the replacement for GIF in
picture postings.  JFIF is simpler than TIFF and is available now; the
TIFF 6.0 spec has only recently been officially adopted, and it is still
unusably vague on some crucial details.  Even when TIFF/JPEG is well
defined, the JFIF format is likely to be a widely supported ""lowest common
denominator""; TIFF/JPEG files may never be as transportable.

A particular case that people may be interested in is Apple's QuickTime
software for the Macintosh.  QuickTime uses a JFIF-compatible format wrapped
inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and
QuickTime JPEG is pretty straightforward, and several Mac programs are
available to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor
that handles binary files, you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF
by hand; see section 11 for details.

Another particular case is Handmade Software's programs (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and
Image Alchemy).  These programs are capable of reading and writing JFIF
format.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format developed by
HSI.  This format is NOT readable by any non-HSI programs and should not be
used for Usenet postings.  Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (This
applies to old versions of these programs; the current releases emit JFIF
format by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format
files, unless you want to get flamed by people on non-PC platforms.)


[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?

If you have an alleged JPEG file that your software won't read, it's likely
to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-based format.  You can tell
what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file:

1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the characters (hex) FF D8 FF E0,
    followed by two variable bytes (often hex 00 10), followed by 'JFIF'.

2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a
    ""raw JPEG"" file.  This is probably decodable as-is by JFIF software ---
    it's worth a try, anyway.

3.  HSI files start with 'hsi1'.  You're out of luck unless you have HSI
    software.  Portions of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they
    won't decompress properly with non-HSI programs.

4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compressed, will have a couple hundred
    bytes of header followed by a JFIF header (scan for 'JFIF').  Strip off
    everything before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.

5.  Anything else: it's a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are
    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.
    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),
    try stripping off everything before that.

In uuencoded Usenet postings, the characteristic JFIF pattern is

	""begin"" line
	M_]C_X ...

whereas uuencoded HSI files will start with

	""begin"" line
	M:'-I ...

If you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of
downloading non-JFIF files.


[12]  What about arithmetic coding?

The JPEG spec defines two different ""back end"" modules for the final output
of compressed data: either Huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed.
The choice has no impact on image quality, but arithmetic coding usually
produces a smaller compressed file.  On typical images, arithmetic coding
produces a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman coding.  (All the
file-size numbers previously cited are for Huffman coding.)

Unfortunately, the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the
JPEG standard is subject to patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.
Thus *you cannot legally use arithmetic coding* unless you obtain licenses
from these companies.  (The ""fair use"" doctrine allows people to implement
and test the algorithm, but actually storing any images with it is dubious
at best.)

At least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about
arithmetic coding; the space savings isn't great enough to justify the
potential legal hassles.  In particular, arithmetic coding *should not*
be used for any images to be exchanged on Usenet.

There is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the
future.  Stay tuned for further details.


[13]  Does loss accumulate with repeated compression/decompression?

It would be nice if, having compressed an image with JPEG, you could
decompress it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompress it
without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially.
Unfortunately THIS IS NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompressing an altered
image loses more information, though usually not as much as was lost the
first time around.

The next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress
it *without changing it* then there is no further loss, i.e., you get an
identical JPEG file.  Even this is not true; at least, not with the current
free JPEG software.  It's essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff
error.  If you repeatedly compress and decompress, the image will eventually
degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first-generation
output.  (It usually takes many such cycles to get visible change.)
One of the things on our to-do list is to see if accumulation of error can
be avoided or limited, but I am not optimistic about it.

In any case, the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that
compressing the unmodified full-color output of djpeg, at the original
quality setting, would introduce no further loss.  Even such simple changes
as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.
(If you're wondering why, it's because the pixel-block boundaries move.
If you cropped off only multiples of 16 pixels, you might be safe, but
that's a mighty limited capability!)

The bottom line is that JPEG is a useful format for archival storage and
transmission of images, but you don't want to use it as an intermediate
format for sequences of image manipulation steps.  Use a lossless format
(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while working on the image, then JPEG it when you are
ready to file it away.  Aside from avoiding degradation, you will save a lot
of compression/decompression time this way :-).


[14]  What are some rules of thumb for converting GIF images to JPEG?

As stated earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you
convert an existing GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original
full-color data the GIF was made from, it's far better to make a JPEG from
that.  But if you need to save space and have only the GIF to work from,
here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum
loss of quality.

The first rule when converting a GIF library is to look at each JPEG, to
make sure you are happy with it, before throwing away the corresponding GIF;
that will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality
setting if necessary.  Some GIFs may be better left as GIFs, as explained in
section 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIFs with sixteen or fewer colors
don't convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality
will be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the sizes too.)

Experience to date suggests that large, high-visual-quality GIFs are the best
candidates for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer
the most potential savings, and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.
Don't waste your time converting any GIF much under 100 Kbytes.  Also, don't
expect JPEG files converted from GIFs to be as small as those created
directly from full-color originals.  To maintain image quality you may have
to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight-through
JPEG files would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,
not 1/4th as suggested in earlier comparisons).

Many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant-color
border around a GIF image.  While useless, this was nearly free in terms of
storage cost in GIF files.  It is NOT free in JPEG files, and the sharp
border boundary can create visible artifacts (""ghost"" edges).  Do yourself
a favor and crop off any border before JPEGing.  (If you are on an X Windows
system, XV's manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless
way to do this.)

cjpeg's default Q setting of 75 is appropriate for full-color input, but
for GIF inputs, Q settings of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid
image degradation.  (If you apply smoothing as suggested below, the higher
Q setting may not be necessary.)

Color GIFs of photographs or complex artwork are usually ""dithered"" to fool
your eye into seeing more than the 256 colors that GIF can actually store.
If you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixels are often of
significantly different colors; at normal size the eye averages these pixels
together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The
trouble with dithering is that, to JPEG, it looks like high-spatial-frequency
color noise; and JPEG can't compress noise very well.  The resulting JPEG
file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have
gotten from JPEGing the original full color image (if you had it).
To get around this, you want to ""smooth"" the GIF image before compression.
Smoothing averages together nearby pixels, thus approximating the color that
you thought you saw anyway, and in the process getting rid of the rapid
color changes that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smoothing will
often let you avoid using a high Q factor, thus further reducing the size of
the compressed file, while still obtaining a better-looking output image
than you'd get without smoothing.

With the V4 free JPEG software (or products based on it), a simple smoothing
capability is built in.  Try ""-smooth 10"" or so when converting GIFs.
Values of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIFs.  Heavy-handed
dithering may require larger smoothing factors.  (If you can see regular
fine-scale patterns on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong
smoothing is definitely called for.)  Too large a smoothing factor will blur
the output image, which you don't want.  If you are an image processing
wizard, you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program, such as
pnmconvol from the PBMPLUS package.  However, cjpeg's built-in smoother is
a LOT faster than pnmconvol...

The upshot of all this is that ""cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10"" is probably a
good starting point for converting GIFs.  But if you really care about the
image, you'll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings.

Are you saying that the Indians who became Christians did so because the
US Army marched them into church at gunpoint?

This will be news to the Indians of the Great Lakes and upper Mississippi
basin-- of the Southwest-- of Mexico and South America-- who converted even
before there was such a thing as the US.  Are you saying that Indians are
incapable of coming to a decision themselves about their religion without
being forced to at gunpoint?  What about the Christian Cherokees who were
given the boot by the US government after the Civil War... because the
Cherokee nation gave mild support to the Confederacy, since they themselves

I am digitizing a NTSC signal and displaying on a PC video monitor.
It is known that the display response of tubes is non-linear and is
sometimes said to follow Gamma-Law. I am not certain if these
non-linearities are ""Gamma-corrected"" before encoding NTSC signals
or if the TV display is supposed to correct this.
 
Also, if  256 grey levels, for example, are coded in a C program do
these intensity levels appear with linear brightness on a PC

correct for ""gamma errrors""?

Getting one in Scandinavia (and northern europe) is not easy.

This seems to be one of the main problems; Any harder gun-control

Either some of you are a little paranoid (no offence...) OR you should

Guns 'n Criminals:
MOST weapons used by criminals today are stolen.
Known criminals can NOT buy weapons, that's one of the points of gun control.
And because gun control are strict in WHOLE scandinavia (and most of europe),
we dont have any PROBLEM with smuggled guns.

Mixing weapons and things that can be use as one:
What I meant was that cars CAN kill, but they are not GUNS!
Someone said that if we 'ban' guns we'd have to ban cars to, because they 'kill' to...
I don't think we should argue on this one..... ;)

The issue (I hope..):
I think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem.
Guns are not a problem, but the way they are used is.... (and what are they for??)

I think this discusion is interesting when you think of (ex)Jugoslavia:
They should all have weapons, it's their rigth to have them, and if they use them
to kill other (Innocent) people the problem is humans, not guns.

If 50% of ALL murders was done with axes, would you impose some regulations on them
or just say that they are ment to be used at trees, and that the axe is not a problem,
it's the 'axer' ??
(An example, don't flame me just because not exactly 50% are killed by guns...)

Think about the situation in Los Angeles where people are buying guns to protect
themselves. Is this a good situation ?? Is it the rigth way to deal with the problem ??

If everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals (and their neighbor who have
guns) what do you think will happen ?? (I mean if everybody had a gun in USA)

Don't flame the Englishmen because of Northern Irland, they have gun control that works

"
	Oh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had
negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,
now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent
hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,
he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't 
know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are
similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field,
he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his
OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)
was a absolute-primo-dick.  
	Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that
MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the
MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.  
	Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s
solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks 
(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been 
a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  
	You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,
simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you 
blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)
Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, 
the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should 
HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.
	Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like
Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.


	Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?


	Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the
position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along
the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a 
good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more
recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early
80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's
offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his
career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer
:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.
	Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real
stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,
and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as
SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.


	Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a ""mediot"" 
candidate, pushed because of his ""winning attitude"" (a minor factor, if one
at all), and his ""great defense"" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of
a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.
	SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last
year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk
about Morris' ""ability to win"" which is nothing more than Morris' ""ability
to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs"".  At this point, Morris is an
average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned 
close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the
80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year
for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but
not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF
""consideration"".  
	Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will
throw back your earlier logic about ""Yount and Smith being shortstops who 
hung around a long time"".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's 
just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...
(Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)
	Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few
more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most
likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much
regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY 
tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and
legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the
league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the
end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.

	This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it 
or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off
the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably
left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.  I won't consider ANYONE
who started playing after about 1985 (again, too early to tell.) [Note: these
are all active players, I'm not counting recent retirees]

Baltimore:  Cal Ripken (should be a lock by now, even if Gehrig's record stands)
Boston: Roger Clemens (might be a lock already, which is amazing), Dawson (?)
Detroit: Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker (possibilities)
Milwaukee: Robin Yount (discussed earlier)
New York: Wade Boggs (possibly), Mattingly (long shot)
Toronto: Paul Molitor and Jack Morris (possibilities)

Kansas City: George Brett (lock)
Minnesota: Kirby (too early to tell), Winfield (lock)
Oakland: Eckersley (lock), McGwire (too early), Rickey (lock), Welch (LONG shot)
Texas: The Mighty Nolan [Too early to consider Canseco or Strange :-)]

Cubs: Sandberg (lock)
St. Louis: Ozzie (lock), Lee Smith (probably)
New York: Murray (almost a lock), Saberhagen (obviously, he's got to regain
				  	      past form)
[And most certainly, NOT Vince Coleman, despite what he'll tell you :-)]

Los Angeles: Butler, Strawberry, and Hershiser are all long shots.
San Diego: Tony Gwynn (pretty good shot)
Colorado: Dale Murphy (a good shot), Ryan Bowen (just to see if you're awake)

	[Before I get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's
probably a few deserving candidates that I left off, and, I didn't include
Barry Bonds, Will Clark, Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher, Frank Thomas, Canseco,
McGriff, etc. because I only considered guys who started playing before
1985)]

They do. According the the Los Angeles Police Department, illegal
manufacture is one the three primary sources of machine guns and
submachine guns used in crimes (sumggling and theft from the
police and military being the other two.) Washington D.C. police
have stated that 40% (If I'm remembering the figure correctly) of
the guns they conficate were illegally built.


It takes about 6 hours and a few tools to make one (at least one
of reasonable quality). Unless the drug dealer enjoyes messing
around on a lathe (say, as a hobby), he's going to have to 
pay someone anyway. Materials plus six hours of a machinist's
time for something legal would run about $100. The blackmarket
prices for guns are usually in the $50 to $200 range (at least
those few I've seen cited in newspaper articles were...)


Washington D.C. has a total ban on handguns and prohibits assembled
rifles within city limits. It's homicide rate is almost ten
times the national average. It is also illegal for a D.C.
resident to drive to the Virginia or Maryland suburbs and
buy a gun (dealers are required by federal law to check IDs
and make sure the buyer isn't from another state) so the ban 
can not be easily side-stepped.


Sure. But it you couldn't buy one, you would write your own (in
fact, people _did_ write their own 15 years ago...) More likely,
you would find a friend who was a particularly good programer
and get him give you a copy of his. Software is a _very_ bad
example for your case: How many people do you know with illegal
copies of $400 word processors? If people want something, and
it isn't available (or affordable) legally, they will usually
get it illegally.


Quite.

Or are you going to restrict sales of sulpher, charcoal and
saltpeter? That's alot cruder than modern smokless powder, but
it works very well. The only real problems are a ~25% reduction
in energy (so a .357 magnum would ""only"" be as deadly as a 9mm)
and it makes alot more smoke... Of course, a smart black marketeer
could just make the gun in 9mm and steal the ammunition from the
police (the police are often corruptable, and things are known
to disappear from police evidence rooms and armories and
reappear on the streets...)

Not to worry.  The Masons have been demonized and harrassed by almost

They may even pick up a little support as people start to listen to the 
Boobtists and realize that subtracting the obvious lies and claims of 
Satanism that the Masons sound pretty good by comparison.  One thing is 
known.  A sizable proportion of Southern Babtists are Masons!  And the 
Masons have already fired back in their own magazines against the 
Boobtist Witch-hunt.
  Since the Consrervatives have already been a divisive element with 
their war on Boobtist moderates and liberals, they may now start in on 
their Mason/Boobtist brothers and hasten their own downfall as more and

"What would all of you out there in net land think of the big 6 (Martin
Mariatta, Boeing, Mcdonell Douglas, General Dynamics, Lockheed, Rockwell)
getting together, and forming a consortium to study exactly what the market
price pints are for building reusable launch vehicles, and spending say
$3million to do that.  Recognizing that most of the military requirements
for launch vehicles are pulled out of a hat somewhere (say, has the shuttle 
ever really used that 1200mi crossrange capability?  You get the idea, figure
out how many, how often, where to, etc...)

Then taking this data, and forming a sematech type company (bad example, I
know... but at least its an example...)  To develop between 3 and 5 craft
designs.  Then to take all of those designs, and figure out EXACTLY what
the technologies are, and demonstrate those technologies, in order to 
eliminate designs that can't be built today.  And lets say that this
portion again funded by the GOV cost about $20 million.

And from here all of these companies went their separate ways, with the
intention of taking all of the market data and the design data to wall
street, and saying ""I want to build this vehicle, and here are the numbers
that show %20 ROI, fund me...)

just this project is shaping up in the background. It seems that the aerospace

   If I read you right, you're saying in essence that, with a larger
   economy, nations will have more discretionary funds to *waste* on a
   lunar facility. That was certainly partially the case with Apollo,
   but real Lunar colonies will probably require a continuing
   military, scientific, or commercial reason for being rather than
   just a ""we have the money, why not?"" approach.

Ah, but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not
wasted on the moon. It's not like they'd be using $1000 (1000R?) bills
to fuel their moon-dozers. The money to fund a lunar base would be
spent in the country to which the base belonged. It's a way of funding
high-tech research, just like DARPA was a good excuse to fund various
fields of research, under the pretense that it was crucial to the
defense of the country, or like ESPRIT is a good excuse for the EC to
fund research, under the pretense that it's good for pan-European
cooperation.

Now maybe you think that government-funded research is a waste of
money (in fact, I'm pretty sure you do), but it does count as
investment spending, which does boost the economy (and just look at
the size of that multiplier :->).",space
"I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers,
notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at
the Stick.

After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was 
very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even
compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).

It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if
Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked
three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.

The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in
addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters
seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb.
McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball.
So on & so forth.

I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before
people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.

For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped
out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor
in helping them significantly improve over last year.",sport

have the right to a dark, uncluttered night sky.

Let me give you an example.  When you watch TV, they have commercials to pay
for the programming.  You accept that as part of watching.  If you don't like
it, you can turn it off.  If you want to view the night sky, and there is a
floating billboard out there, you can't turn it off.  It's the same 
reasoning that limits billboards in scenic areas.

George.

	It's called a democracy.  The majority rules.  sorry.
If ytou don't like it, I suggest you modify the constitution to include
a constitutional right to Dark Skies.   The theory of government
here is that the majority rules,  except in the nature of fundamental
civil rights.

I say: 
	Any reasonably in-depth perusal of American history will show
	you that many WASPs have continued the practices of prejudice,
	discrimination, and violence against others of different
	races, religions, and beliefs, despite the law.

If you really are annoyed,   get some legislation
to create a dark sky zone,  where in all light emissions are protected
in the zone.  Kind of like the national radio quiet zone.  Did you
know about that?  near teh Radio telescope  observatory in West virginia,
they have a 90?????? mile EMCON zone.  Theoretically they can prevent
you from running light AC motors, like air conditioners and Vacuums.
In practice, they use it mostly to  control  large radio users.

I say:
What I'm objecting to here is a floating billboard that, presumably,
would move around in the sky.  I, for one, am against legislating
at all.  I just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy, and
would consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and
aesthetic values that make us human.  This includes the need for wild
and unspoiled things, including the night sky.

  The commercial uses of a transportation system between already-settled-
and-civilized areas are obvious.  Spaceflight is NOT in this position.
The correct analogy is not with aviation of the '30's, but the long
transocean voyages of the Age of Discovery.  It didn't require gov't to
fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit
at the destination.  In practice, some were gov't funded, some were private.
But there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount
of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff.
  I am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop,
and large numbers of people will live and work off-Earth.  But if you ask
me for specific justifications other than the increased resource base, I
can't give them.  We just don't know enough.  The launch rate demanded by
existing space industries is just too low to bring costs down much, and
we are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries
will be, when they will practical, how much will have to be invested to
start them, etc.

******   You may distribute this program freely for non-commercial use
         if no fee is gained.
******   There is no warranty. The author is not responsible for any
         damage caused by this program.


Important changes since version 1.30:
    Fix bugs in file management system (file displaying).
    Improve file management system (more user-friendly).
    Fix bug in XPM version 3 reading.
    Fix bugs in TARGA reading/writng.

    Add support for PCX and GEM/IMG writing.
    Auto-skip macbinary header.


(1) Introduction:
  This program can let you READ, WRITE and DISPLAY images with different
  formats. It also let you do some special effects(ROTATION, DITHERING ....)
  on image. Its main purpose is to let you convert image among different
  formts.
  Include simple file management system.
  Support 'slide show'.
  There is NO LIMIT on image size.
  Currently this program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.
  If you want to use HiColor or TrueColor, you must have VESA driver.
  If you want to modify video driver, please read section (8).


(2) Hardware Requirement:
  PC 386 or better. MSDOS 3.3 or higher.
  min amount of ram is 4M bytes(Maybe less memory will also work).
  (I recommend min 8M bytes for better performance).
  Hard disk for swapping(virtual memory).

  The following description is borrowed from DJGPP.

  Supported Wares:

  * Up to 128M of extended memory (expanded under VCPI)
  * Up to 128M of disk space used for swapping
  * SuperVGA 256-color mode up to 1024x768
  * 80387

  model, SVGA graphics.


(3) Installation:
  Video drivers, emu387 and go32.exe are borrowed from DJGPP.
  (If you use Western Digital VGA chips, read readme.wd)
  (This GO32.EXE is a modified version for vesa and is COMPLETELY compatible
   with original version)
+  *** But some people report that this go32.exe is not compatible with
+      other DJGPP programs in their system. If you encounter this problem,
+      DON'T put go32.exe within search path.

  *** Please read runme.bat for how to run this program.

  If you choose xxxxx.grn as video driver, add 'nc 256' to environment
    GO32.

  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grn nc 256

  If you don't have 80x87, add 'emu x:/xxxxx/emu387' to environment GO32.

  For example, go32=driver x:/xxxxx/xxxxx.grd emu x:/xxxxx/emu387

  **** Notes: 1. I only test tr8900.grn, et4000.grn and vesa.grn.
                 Other drivers are not tested.
              2. I have modified et4000.grn to support 8, 15, 16, 24 bits
                 display. You don't need to use vesa driver.
                 If et4000.grn doesn't work, please try vesa.grn.
              3. For those who want to use HiColor or TrueColor display,
                 please use vesa.grn(except et4000 users).

(7) Detail:

   Initialization:
      Set default display type to highest display type.
      Find allowable screen resolution(for .grn video driver only).

   1. When you run this program, you will enter 'read' menu. Whthin this
      menu you can press any function key except F5. If you move or copy
      files, you will enter 'write' menu. the 'write' menu is much like
      'read' menu, but only allow you to change directory.
+       The header line in 'read' menu includes ""(d:xx,f:xx,t:xx)"".
+         d : display type. f: number of files. t: number of tagged files.
      pressing SPACE in 'read' menu will let you select which format to use
        for reading current file.
      pressing RETURN in 'read' menu will let you reading current file. This
        program will automatically determine which format this file is.
        The procedure is: First, check magic number. If fail, check
        standard extension. Still fail, report error.
      pressing s or S in 'read' menu will do 'Slide Show'.
        If delay time is 0, program will wait until you hit a key
          (except ESCAPE).
        If any error occurs, program will make a beep.
        ESCAPE to terminate.
      pressing Ins in 'read' menu will change display type.
      pressing ALT-X in 'read' menu will quit program without prompting.

   2. Once image file is successfully read, you will enter 'screen' menu.
      Within this menu F5 is turn on. You can do special effect on image.
      pressing RETURN: show image.
        in graphic mode, press RETURN, SPACE or ESCAPE to return to text
        mode.
      pressing TAB: change processing target. This program allows you to do
        special effects on 8-bit or 24-bit image.
      pressing Left,Right arrow: change display type. 8, 15, 16, 24 bits.
      pressing SPACE: save current image to file.
        B/W Dither: save as black/white image(1 bit).
        Grey Scale: save as grey image(8 bits).
        Full Color: save as color image(8 bits).
        True Color: save as 24-bit image.

        This program will ask you some questions if you want to write image
        to file. Some questions are format-dependent. Finally This program
        will prompt you a filename. If you want to save file under another
        directory other than current directory, please press SPACE. after
        pressing SPACE, you will enter 'write2' menu. You can change
        directory to what you want. Then,

        pressing SPACE: this program will prompt you 'original' filename.
        pressing RETURN: this program will prompt you 'selected' filename
                      (filename under bar).


  3. This program supports 8, 15, 16, 24 bits display.

  4. This Program is MEMORY GREEDY. If you don't have enough memory,
     the performance is poor.

  5. If you want to save 8 bits image :
       try GIF then TIFF(LZW) then TARGA then Sun Raster then BMP then ...

     If you want to save 24 bits image (lossless):
       try TIFF(LZW) or TARGA or ILBM or Sun Raster
       (No one is better for true 24bits image)

  6. I recommend Jpeg for storing 24 bits images, even 8 bits images.

  7. Not all subroutines are fully tested

  8. This document is not well written. If you have any PROBLEM, SUGGESTION,
     COMMENT about this program,
     Please send to u7711501@bicmos.ee.nctu.edu.tw (140.113.11.13).
     I need your suggestion to improve this program.

  Of course; sorry for the misunderstanding.  I was referring to the fact
that far more aeronautical development took place in the '30's.  For much
of the '20's, the super-abundance of Jennies and OX-5 engines held down the
industry.  By 1926, many of the obsolete WWI aircraft had been retired
and Whirlwind had their power/weight ratio and reliability up to the point
where long-distance flights became practical.  It's important to note that
the Atlantic was flown not once but THREE times in 1927:  Lindbergh,
Chamberlin and Levine, and Byrd's _America_.  ""When it's time to railroad,
you railroad.""


  Not off the top of my head; I'll have to dig out my reference books again.
However, I will say that the most common arrangement in Prince Henry the
Navigator's Portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and
merchants to put up the rest.  They profits from the voyage would then be
shared.


  The problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a
Moon Base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations
can even consider putting up.  The Kremer Prizes (human powered aircraft),
Orteig's prize, Lord Northcliffe's prize for crossing the Atlantic (won in
1919 by Alcock and Brown) were MUCH smaller.  The technologies required were
within the reach of individual inventors, and the prize amounts were well
within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals.  I think that only
a gov't could afford to set up a $1B+ prize for any purpose whatsoever.
  Note that Burt Rutan suggested that NASP could be built most cheaply by
taking out an ad in AvWeek stating that the first company to build a plane
that could take off and fly the profile would be handed $3B, no questions
asked.

"I am sure  Mary or Henry can describe this more aptly then me.
But here is how i understand it.

At Speed,  Near supersonic.  The wind behaves like a fluid pipe.
It becomes incompressible.  So wind has to bend away from the
wing edges.   AS the wing thickens,  the more the pipes bend.

If they have no place to go,  they begin to stall,  and force
compression, stealing power from the vehicle (High Drag).

If you squeeze the fuselage,  so that these pipes  have aplace to bend
into,  then drag is reduced.   

Essentially,  teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf
remain constant for all areas of the fuselage.  That is where the wings are

I think he wanted to avoid reinventing the wheel.
I would suggest that you take your code, and submit it to
comp.sys.mac.binaries to be distributed (including to the ftp sites). 
Many folks, myself included, would enjoy the extra code.


Just to clarify, the 3D routines that are mentioned in various places
on the mac are in a libray, not the ROM of the mac.  A few years ago before
I knew anything about implementing graphics, I came across a demo of the
Apple GrafSys3D library and it actually did a lot.  However, it is quite
limited in the sense that it's a low-level 3D library; your code still has
to plot individual points, draw each line, etc ad nauseum.  It has nothing
on GL, for example, where you can handle objects.

Other things to consider when talking about Apple's old 3D GrafSys library:

* Unsupported;  never was and no plans exist to do so in the future

* Undocumented; unless you call header files documentation...

If one knows something about graphics, you could probably figure it out,
but I'd assume there's better software available that gives better
output and is, at the same time, programmatically nicer (i.e. easier to
program).

Why was he used as a reliever when the 'Spos had Reardon and BillLee
warming up in the bullpen.  Considering Monday couldn't touch LHP,
Lee would have been a safe bet.  He wasn't even doing any drugs at that
time (or so he told me and around 50 others on a recent venture into 
Montreal.  The blast wasn't the important aspect.  It was the timing.
Seventh game, a tie game, and in the top of the 9th.  The Expos almost
came back though...
2) Mike Schmidt hit one that killed the Expos in 1980.  So close, yet, so
far.
and
3) Strawberry killed a pitch on the second day of the season a couple of
years ago.  It went off the technical ring in the Big O.  It almost left
the stadium!  That was hit HARD!!!

"Well, after suffering from an intense fit of Minnesota-induced cabin fever,
I've decided to road trip to Milwaukee and take in a couple of games this
weekend. A couple games at County stadium will be great to relieve tension, 
but I thought ""Why not go to Wrigley for a game too?""  

  I see the Cubs are playing the Phillies on Sat (2:05 start, I believe
that's Eastern time listed). I figured it would be fun to bounce down to
Wrigley for the day game and live it up a little. I'm wondering if anyone
(esp. Cubbie fans) have some advice on: 

  1) If I'm taking 41 (Skokie Hwy) south until it runs into 94, what's the 
     best way to get to Wrigley? I'm planning on getting there an hour or  
     two early and paying through the nose for parking to keep things easy. 

  2) Is it probable that I'll be able to walk up and get bleacher seats (2 or
     3) on game day? I figure since it's early in the year, Ryno's out and 
     the weather isn't great I should be able to get tickets. If not, what's 
     the best way to get advance tickets; can I call the Cubs' ticket office
     directly and pick up tickets at the will call window?  

  3) Any advice on where to eat before or after the game? 

  4) Do they allow inflatable I-luv-ewe dolls (present from Lundy) into the 
     bleachers? :-)

	+ ""The Operative Term Is STIMULATE"" + 
	-------------------------------------
	---this file last updated..4-21-93---


WHAT IS OTIS?

OTIS is here for the purpose of distributing original artwork
and photographs over the network for public perusal, scrutiny,    
and distribution.  Digital immortality.

The basic idea behind ""digital immortality"" is that computer networks   
are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them
will be around near-forever.  The GIFs and JPGs of today will be the
artifacts of a digital future.  Perhaps they'll be put in different
formats, perhaps only surviving on backup tapes....but they'll be
there...and someone will dig them up.  
 
If that doesn't interest you... OTIS also offers a forum for critique
and exhibition of your works....a virtual art gallery that never closes
and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang
as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors.  Suddenly, life is 
breathed into your work...and by merit of it's stimulus, it will 
travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons.
 
Spectators are welcome also, feel free to browse the gallery and 
let the artists know what you think of their efforts.  Keep your own
copies of the images to look at when you've got the gumption...
that's what they're here for.

---------------------------------------------------------------

WHERE?             

OTIS currently (as of 4/21/93) has two FTP sites.  
 
 	141.214.4.135 (projects/otis), the UWI site
		
	sunsite.unc.edu (/pub/multimedia/pictures/OTIS), the SUNsite 
	(you can also GOPHER to this site for OTIS as well)

Merely ""anonymous FTP"" to either site on Internet and change to the
appropriate directory.  Don't forget to get busy and use the ""bin""
command to make sure you're in binary.

OTIS has also been spreading to some dial-up BBS systems around North
America....the following systems have a substancial supply of
OTIStuff...
	Underground Cafe (Omaha) (402.339.0179) 2 lines
	CyberDen (SanFran?) (415.472.5527)  Usenet Waffle-iron

--------------------------------------------------------------
 
HOW DO YOU CONTRIBUTE?
              
What happens is...you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely   
photo, get it scanned into an image file, then either FTP-put
it in the CONTRIB/Incoming directory or use UUENCODE to send it to me
(email addresses at eof) in email.  After the image is received,
it will be put into the correct directory.  Computer originated works
are also welcome.

OTIS' directories house two types of image files, GIF and JPG.  
GIF and JPG files require, oddly enough, a GIF or JPG viewer to 
see.  These viewers are available for all types of computers at 
most large FTP sites around Internet.  JPG viewers are a bit
tougher to find.  If you can't find one, but do have a GIF viewer,  
you can obtain a JPG-to-GIF conversion program which will change    
JPG files to a standard GIF format. 

OTIS also accepts animation files.      

When you submit image files, please send me email at the same time
stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be
used (in publications or other projects) or if it is merely for people
to view.  Also, include some biographical information on yourself, we'll
be having info-files on each contributing artist and their works.  You 
can also just upload a text-file of info about yourself (instead of 
emailing).

If you have pictures, but no scanner, there is hope.  Merely send
copies to:

The OTIS Project
c/o Ed Stastny
PO BX 241113
Omaha, NE 68124-1113

I will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will  
scan them.  Include an ample SASE if you want your stuff back.  
Also include information on each image, preferably a 1-3 line 
description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the
directory where it's finally put.  If you have preferences as to what
the images are to be named, include those as well.  
 
Conversely, if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please
contact me and we'll arrange things.

If you want to submit your works by disk, peachy.  Merely send a 3.5""
disk to the above address (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.
This is good for people who don't have direct access to encoders or FTP,
but do have access to a scanner.  We accept disks in either Mac or IBM
compatible format.  If possible, please submit image files as GIF or
JPG.  If you can't...we can convert from most formats...we'd just rather
not have to.

At senders request, we can also fill disks with as much OTIS as they
can stand.  Even if you don't have stuff to contribute, you can send
a blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and packing) to 
get a slab-o-OTIS.

As of 04/21/93, we're at about 18 megabytes of files, and growing.  
Email me for current archive size and directory.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

DISTRIBUTION?

The images distributed by the OTIS project may be distributed freely   
on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is
not altered in any way (save to convert from one image format to
another).  In fact, we encourage files to be distributed to local 
bulletin boards and such.  If you could, please transport the
appropriate text files along with the images.  
 
It would also be nice if you'd send me a note when you did post images
from OTIS to your local bbs.  I just want to keep track of them so
participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is.

It's the purpose of OTIS to get these images spread out as much as
possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite
BBS system....or even just post this ""info-file"" there.  It would be
keen of you.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

USE?

If you want to use any of the works you find on the OTIS directory,
you'll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the 
stipulations of the permission (such as free copy of publication, or
full address credit).  You will either find this in the "".rm"" file for    
the image or series of images...or in the ""Artists"" directory under the 
Artists name.  If permission isn't explicitly given, then you'll have 
to contact the artist to ask for it.  If no info is available, email
me (ed@cwis.unomaha.edu), and I'll get in contact with the artist for 
you, or give you their contact information.
 
When you DO use permitted work, it's always courteous to let the artist
know about it, perhaps even send them a free copy or some such
compensation for their files.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

NAMING IMAGES?

Please keep the names of your files in ""dos"" format.  That means, keep
the filename (before .jpg or .gif) to eight characters or less.  The way
I usually do it is to use the initials of the artist, plus a three or
four digit ""code"" for the series of images, plus the series number.
Thus, Leonardo DeVinci's fifth mechanical drawing would be something
like:
 
	ldmek5.gif     OR    ldmek5.jpg    OR    ldmech5.gif   ETC

Keeping the names under 8 characters assures that the filename will
remain intact on all systems.  


---------------------------------------------------------------------- 

CREATING IMAGE FILES?

When creating image files, be sure to at least include your name
somewhere on or below the picture.  This gives people a reference in
case they'd like to contact you.  You may also want to include a title,
address or other information you'd like people to know.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

That's about it for now.  More ""guidelines"" will be added as needed.
Your input is expected.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

DISCLAIMER:  The OTIS Project is here for the distribution of original 
 	     image files.  The files will go to the public at large.  
	     It's possible, as with any form of mass-media, that someone
	     could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain.  
    	     Unless you've given permission for that, it's illegal.  OTIS
	     takes no responsibility for this.  In simple terms, all rights
	     revert to the author/artist.  To leave an image on OTIS is to 
	     give permission for it to be viewed, copied and distributed 
	     electronically.  If you don't want your images distributed     
	     all-over, don't upload them.  To leave an image on OTIS is
	     NOT giving permission to have it used in any publication or
	     broadcast that incurs profit (this includes, but is not 
	     limited to, magazines, newsletters, clip-art software,        
	     screen-printed clothing, etc).  You must give specific
	     permission for this sort of usage.

that'd be interested in this sort of thing...get them involved...kick'm

People like Howard Metzenbaum seem very intent on diluting the 2nd amendment
to the point where it is no effort for the governmentski to do what they

After all, from what I know of the Federalist papers, it is this kind of
tyranny the 2nd amendment was supposed to be designed to protect against.

Honestly! M-60 tanks against the civilian population! Attack helicopters!

We need the right to keep and bear anti-tank weapons. Actually, if they

we need the right to field tactical nukes. Government tyranny! Who would
have ever thought it would happen here!

I wonder who'se house they'll run tanks through next, because the gov.

And what is an Illegal Weapon (which they have yet to show us), if the
2nd amendment is designed to do what I believe it is, and the gov. uses
tanks against you? Government self-serving? Naaaah. Not here.

"The European Space Agency has involvement with remote earth

So it's not just the US/USSR(ex) who are in the game.

But what *is* the game? What can be done with space observation?
The military functions of missile spotting, troop spotting etc. are well
documented, but what about anything else?

The biggest eg I can think of is to get a  metal sensing sat over a
paying country and scan their territory for  precious metals.

More importantly, if radar can spot water vapour (clouds), presumably
a radar based sat will be capable of spotting rivers,open water and 
*underground water* from space. This would be a positive life saver
for African or other drought affected countries. Implementing a
clean water and irrigation program would be of imense benifit to such
countries and should cut down mortalities considerably.

So how about it? Is there a charity or government agency that would
pay for a third world country to have their minerals and water deposits
mapped?

"The Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their
quest for more left-handed pitching.  So far, no takers.
Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he
has also led the team in past years for hitting into double
plays, or at least been among the leaders.
 
Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play
every day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just
one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.
 
Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed.
The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an
effect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez
were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays.
Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might
have seen him lifted in the third in past years.
 
Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances.
The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls
in the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great
on defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to
steal and has at least one pick off at first.
 
Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on
defense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers
some runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average.

    FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ON SCI.SPACE/SCI.ASTRO

    INTRODUCTION

    This series of linked messages is periodically posted to the Usenet
groups sci.space and sci.astro in an attempt to provide good answers to
frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth
preserving. If you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked
questions that you would like included in this posting, send email to
leech@cs.unc.edu (Jon Leech).

    If you don't want to see the FAQ, add 'Frequently Asked Questions' to
your KILL file for this group (if you're not reading this with a newsreader
that can kill articles by subject, you're out of luck).

    The FAQ volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down
by rewriting and condensing over time. The FAQ postings are available in
the Ames SPACE archive in FAQ/faq<#>.

    Good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here. The
point of this is to circulate existing information, and avoid rehashing old
answers. Better to build on top than start again. Nothing more depressing
than rehashing old topics for the 100th time. References are provided
because they give more complete information than any short generalization.

    Questions fall into three basic types:

    1) Where do I find some information about space?

    Try your local public library first. The net is not a good place to ask
    for general information. Ask INDIVIDUALS (by email) if you must. There
    are other sources, use them, too. The net is a place for open ended
    discussion.

    2) I have an idea which would improve space flight?

    Hope you aren't surprised, but 9,999 out of 10,000 have usually been
    thought of before. Again, contact a direct individual source for
    evaluation. NASA fields thousands of these each day.

    3) Miscellanous queries.

    These are addressed on a case-by-case basis in the following series of
    FAQ postings.


    SUGGESTIONS FOR BETTER NETIQUETTE

    Read news.announce.newusers if you're on Usenet.
    Minimize cross references, [Do you REALLY NEED to?]
    Edit ""Subject:"" lines, especially if you're taking a tangent.
    Send mail instead, avoid posting follow ups. (1 mail message worth
	100 posts).
    Internet mail readers: send requests to add/drop to SPACE-REQUEST
	not SPACE.
    Read all available articles before posting a follow-up. (Check all

    Put a return address in the body (signature) of your message (mail

To the degree that relativism is a more accurate decription of the
truth than is objectivism, it provides more power and ability to
control events.

Assuming, for the moment, that morals _are_ relative, then two
relativists can recognize that neither has a lock on the absolute
truth and they can proceed to negotiate a workable compromise that
produces the desired results.

Assuming that there is an absolute morality, two disagreeing 
objectivists can either be both wrong or just one of them right; there
is no room for compromise.  Once you beleive in absolute morals,
you must accept that you are amoral or that everyone who disagrees
with you is amoral.

Given a choice between a peaceful compromise or endless contention,
I'd say that compromise seems to be ""better"".

It still applies, except the astronomy these days is Very Long Baseline
Radio Astronomy coupled to GPS and Satellite Laser Ranging. The data
from NASA's and the Naval Observatory's (among others) is a vital 
source of data for studies into crustal dynamics, Earth rotation, and
purturbations. Every time there is a leap second added to the New Year,
remember the military and science are still co-habiting nicely. The
same VLBI was used to track Gallileo as it passed the Earth, and used
so little fuel that it can afford to observe Ida.

"Hi! Everyone,

Because no one has touched the problem I posted last week, I guess
my question was not so clear. Now I'd like to describe it in detail:

The offset of an ellipse is the locus of the center of a circle which
rolls on the ellipse. In other words, the distance between the ellipse
and its offset is same everywhere.

This problem comes from the geometric measurement when a probe is used.
The tip of the probe is a ball and the computer just outputs the
positions of the ball's center. Is the offset of an ellipse still
an ellipse? The answer is no! Ironically, DMIS - an American Indutrial
Standard says it is ellipse. So almost all the software which was
implemented on the base of DMIS was wrong. The software was also sold
internationaly. Imagine, how many people have or will suffer from this bug!!!
How many qualified parts with ellipse were/will be discarded? And most
importantly, how many defective parts with ellipse are/will be used?

I was employed as a consultant by a company in Los Angeles last year
to specially solve this problem. I spent two months on analysis of this
problem and six months on programming. Now my solution (nonlinear)
is not ideal because I can only reconstruct an ellipse from its entire
or half offset. It is very difficult to find the original ellipse from
a quarter or a segment of its offset because the method I used is not
analytical. I am now wondering if I didn't touch the base and make things
complicated. Please give me a hint.

I know you may argue this is not a CG problem. You are right, it is not.
However, so many people involved in the problem ""sphere from 4 poits"".
Why not an ellipse? And why not its offset?

Please post here and let the others share our interests 
(I got several emails from our netters, they said they need the
summary of the answers).",graphics

                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


       The ""used to kill"" is the heart of the misinformation.  It's one
of those technically accurate phrasings that conveys the wrong impression.
What Mr. Quiqley is more than aware of, I'm sure, is that when people
read this they think violent arguments where one member of the family
grabs a gun and shoots another, thereby creating a tragic situation
which could easily have been avoided had the gun not been there, or
a tragic accident, especially involving a child.

       Unfortunately, that's not the way things stack up.  The majority
of that 43 ""times"" (37 I believe) are suicides.  That is, someone 
intentionally took a firearm and shot themselves intending to kill 
themselves.  And why it's popular to try and blame suicides on guns,
the evidence doesn't support this.  Internal studies, as well as
comparative studies with other countries, indicate that cultural
factors far outweigh whether a person will kill themselves or not.
(Japan, for instance, has a slightly higher rate than the U.S.  There
people jump off buildings.)

       According to the National Crime Survey, 40% of violent crime
is commited by ""non-strangers,"" which mistakenly has been generalized
regarding the King County study to mean, ""Friends and family.""  That
is, Mr. Quigley, and others who quote this statistic, are banking on
the mental image that a ""Friend, family member, or child,"" equates
to a loving relationship, and that it was cut short in a moment of
anger.  Unfortunately, all too often husbands beat and kill wives,
children assault parents, or vice-versa.  Most rapes are commited by 
someone known to the victim, for instance.  Essentially, that a gun
was used against a ""friend"" or family member doesn't mean they
weren't trying to hurt the other person.  Crime is highest among
poor urban families, and those are also the areas most ""at risk""
for family problems, especially violent ones.  A son in a gang may
not be as loving toward his parents if they disapprove than a suburban
kid might.

       Finally, it hinges on the fallacy that a dead intruder is the
only value of a self-defense firearm.  Using the minimum figures I
worked out using the NCS I got about an 80:1 ratio between deadly
self-defenses (justifiable homicides) and with-gun self-defenses.
Between the FBI Uniform Crime report and the NCS there's an enormous
amount of data and anybody with the calculator can crunch the numbers.
As such it is incorrect to assume that a dead body is the only valid
means of determining the success of such a defense, since according
to the NCS (which has been considered by many to seriously under-report
defenses) there were far more successful with-gun defenses than intruders
killed.

       Not it also confines itself to the home, where attack by a ""friend
or family member"" is far, far more likely, and excludes any defense
which occurs outside the home.  (I believe a large number occur in
businesses.)


       I have not seen the exact data for this, so I can't comment.  I
will point out Canada's and Japan's suicide rate as indications that
culture far more than firearm availability affect suicide rates.

       There was also a comparative study between Canada (for what
it's worth, considering the difficulty of comparing across cultural

Yes.  But this is *irrelevant*.  You're talking about averages, when we
have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our
decisions on.

I might as well say ""We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet
tall, so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4.""


Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after
adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an
absolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.

As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the
minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't
believe there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good
season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent
season?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to
use.


The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he
hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager
to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him
down ""until he gets warmed up"".


Most players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do
with Javy Lopez?


See above.  


But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most
players aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year
either.


And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.


Not superstars, not stars, not even good players.  Maybe average, if we're
being charitable.


Ummm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year
in his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a
big question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and
has rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who's in).  Blauser is a very valuable
bat... for a shortstop.



Wanna bet?  The difference between Lopez's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be
20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player
with experience and a player who can play, I'll take the latter every time.


Just like Keith Mitchell did?


That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they
really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience,
or some combination of the two.  I think my interpretation was more
flattering to the organization.

There are roughly 1200 fatal, firearms-related accidents each year.
The large majority involve rifles and shotgun; there are under 500
fatal handgun accidents each year. I really doubt all of those
occur while the pistol is holstered, so the number of ""self-inflicted
gunshot wounds by people wearing thigh holsters"" is probably
well under 250 per year.


Handguns designs have included a ""hammer block"" since around 1960
or earlier. This is a metal part which physically seperates
the cartridge and the firing pin: Even under impact, the gun
cannot fire. The hammer block is connected to the trigger and
is pulled out of the way as the trigger is pulled. As a result,
modern pistols can fire _only_ if the trigger is pulled (or 
in some cases, if they are cocked by hand and then dropped.) 


I don't know about animal attacks, but there are 23,500 murders 
each year and under 500 die in the manner you suggest. If only
2.1% of the murders were killings by ""wacko""s, you would be
wrong. Worse, there are also 102,500 rapes and 1,055,000 aggravated
assaults each year. These numbers make violent attacks, and 
preventing them, thousands of times more significant than the
accidents you are worried about.

(These figures, by the way, are from the FBI's ""Uniform Crime
Report"" for 1990. I'll stop by a library tomorrow and look at
the ""National Crime Victimization Survey"", which is more
specific about where and when the crimes occured.)",politics

about the old ballyard place. Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long,

I went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was 
a much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but 
everything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are
CLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite.

"Dear Rob,


Sometimes I do come across condesending, and I am sorry I come across that
way at times.  Thank you for the reproach, I really do appreciate it.  I'll
try to get better.

Rob, at the same time, I have also learned that some people respond to the gentle
approach while others respond only at a harsh rebuke.  Brian K., so far,
only responds to the latter.  And I am glad he responds at all.   In both
cases of approach,  my intention is to be loving.  I am making no excuse
for myself if I am coming across condesending.  I apologize for that.

Rob, sometimes Brian K. comes across as honest. I know this.  But Brian K. 
vasillates back and forth.  One post looks honest; the next is
an excuse.  Now he wants me to explain the universe in 50 words or less.  
I think Brian Kendig is really trying but he is too comfortable with
his set of excuses.  

I just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he really wants
to know, he will ask questions and stop asserting irrelevant excuses
which have nothing to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the
Bible for himself and come to his own decisions without being
sidetracked with the temptation to mock God.

From my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man
standing out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I 
see a Mack truck heading right for him, but Brian K. is faced away
from the oncoming truck.  He doesn't see it.   Here's is how I see
the dialog:


Me:  ""Brian K, please step aside before you get run over."" 

BK:  ""There is no truck.""

Me:  ""Turn around at look.""

BK:  ""No.""

Me:  ""Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at
     the oncoming truck.""

BK:  ""No. Explain to me why trucks exist.""

Me:  ""Turn around or you will run over.""

BK:  ""No. I won't because I like hiking and tomorrow is Tuesday.""

Me:  ""You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have nothing
      to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certainly lose your life.""
      I do not want to see you squashed all over the road.

BK:  ""It is my life to lose.  I rather not look.
      Besides, a truck running over me will not harm me.""
      And by the way, I really have an open mind.""


So is my motivation to belittle Brian, or to love Brian the best I know how?   

I do not wish to single Brian Kendig out.  Because millions if not
billions of people fall into the same category.  Perhaps all people
fall have fallen into this category at one time in their lives.  I have.
I can now see the truck behind Brian.

My hope is that Brian will look and will see the ramifications of the
truck coming towards him.  My hope is that Brian will want to step out
of the way.  My fear, though,  is that Brian will instead choose to glue himself
to the middle of the highway, where he will certainly get run over.  But if
he so chooses, he so chooses, and there is nothing I can do beyond that
to change his mind.   For it is his choice.   But at this very moment,
Brian hasn't gotten even that far.  He is still at the point where he
does not want to look.  Sure he moves his eyeball to appease me, but his
head will not turn around to see the entire picture.  So far he is
satisfied with his glimpse of the mountains off in the distance. ",religion

Such a measure would also have another benefit. It would relieve the
various states of the thorny problem of what to do with the hundreds
of millions of dollars hunters pour into the economy annually. I'm
sure that, to attain sure a lofty, humane, liberal and ecologically

rights groups/individuals supporting such a measure would be more than
willing to add their names to a list of supporters seeking increased
taxation to replace these lost revenues. I am equally confident that
these same entities, given their noteworthy record in the area of social
responsibility and respect for private property, would feel morally
and ethically bound to raise the necessary funds to acquire the
hundreds of thousands of acres of land now held in private hands
solely for use as private hunting preserves by the landowner(s). To
do less than this would place these same groups/individuals in

I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues.
The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they
had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example,
was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign.
His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie
year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so
and then rebound.

Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had
good numbers immediately.

I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and
Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up
that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it
didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.  I seem to recall CM pitching
well initially, though I don't have stats handy.",sport

OK, I don't use CView anymore, but I saw that no one had explaind this
""bug"" in the thread, so here goes:

It is NOT the fault of CView.  It is DOS!  If you leave a file open on a
floppy drive, then change the disk and do something which updates or closes
that file, you have a good chance of getting part of the directory and FAT
from the other disk written to the new disk.  This has always been true,
and has destroyed data under other programs, not just CView.

The only thing CView can do to improve the situation is to try not to leave
files open unless it's actively using them (ie, reading and decoding).

"-*----

The two commandments *are* rules; they are merely rules that are
so vague that they are practically devoid of meaning.  Michael
Siemon acknowledges this every time he writes that the resolution
of an argument over them turns on secular and cultural
assumptions that are independent of these rules.
 

The commandment to love your neighbor as yourself can be viewed,
in part, as reminding man that he is not God and cannot act as if
he has ""ultimate responsibility."" Indeed, many traditions present
an interpretation where believers are supposed to interpret
loving one's neighbor as following various other rules, and
relying on their god to make things come out right, precisely
because it would be wrong for man to assume such ""ultimate
responsibility."" Once again, we are confronted with good sounding
goo that means whatever the reader wants it to mean. 


And who is to say that this interpretation is ""twisted""?  There
are many passages in the Bible that in their most straightforward
reading show the Christian god behaving in just this way.
Michael cannot refer to ""base"" claims or base commandments to
show that such readings are ""twisted,"" because this divergence in
understanding occurs even in trying to interpret the ""base""
claims and commandments.  In addressing conservative Christians,
Michael will necessarily draw upon secular and cultural notions
that these conservative Christians will reject.  


But these base commandments are too vague to serve as  ""a
principle for the CRITIQUE of ethical systems."" The meaning of
these base commandments for any believer derives from the secular
and cultural notions that the believer brings to them, from how
the believer mixes their demands with straightforward readings of
other Biblical passages, from a particular sectarian tradition,
or from some combination of these things.  These commandments
lack sufficient substance in themself to serve as a basis for
criticizing ethical systems.  What meaning they have comes from
the ethical system the believer brings to these commandments. 


Jesus explicitly states that this summarizes Jewish law, which
would seem to bring in all of it if we properly understand what
it means to love God and love our neighbors.  There are *many*
parables and teachings the gospels attribute to Jesus that are
straightforwardly read as ethical commandments.  The Pauline
epistles are similarly full.  If it is not clear that these all
come together in a sensible understanding of ethical behavior,
the problem is *not* a lack of raw material. 

-*----

No, Michael, the conservative Christians also take the gospel 
seriously.  What differentiates you is the way you interpret the
gospel.


In a sense, the wide variety of interpretations does tell us
something about Christianity.  It tells us that the New Testament
authors left a sufficiently vague hodge-podge that it can serve
as the source text for many, vastly different beliefs about the
nature of the Christian god and about what men should and
shouldn't do. 

The irony here is that there is *nothing* in Christianity per
se that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbians and
gays.  *Every* Christian principle he turns to this cause is
effective only through the extra-Christian principles through
which Michael interprets his religion, and the homophobes apply
the *same* Christian principles, with equal justification, to
their cause.  In short, it is the extra-Christian principles that
make Michael's Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would
be as beneficial, perhaps moreso, without being filtered by
Christian interpretation.  

Michael paints a picture of ""standard American atheism"" as the
rejection of the evil in many conservative Christian
interpretations of the Bible.  But I think it is even more
damaging to Christianity to note that the New Testament presents
such a vague hodge-podge of notions about the nature of God and
the nature of the good (except, of course, when it is ordered by
an interpretation that relies on extraneous principles).  Here, I
think we should apply a Christian parable, where a cold drink can
have its value and a hot drink can have its value, but the
lukewarm we should spit out. ",religion

I'd count that as a fear of guns... somebody having the sense to keep their

it, but will not purchase anything of his ever again without THOROUGHLY

The book is inconsistent, and filled with selective analysis.  James
claims to be looking forward, and then makes some absolutely bizarre

I would like to add my support for a misc.taoism discussion group.
I applaud the enthusiam shown by the person posting <79899@cup.portal.com> 
""Thyagi@cup.portal.com"" (I read in alt.magick), but I differ
with him/her in believing that at least some minimal parameters 
should be agreed upon.



But if we don't limit it to *something*, the discussion degenerates into
a big amorphous glob. 

Other questions Thyagi proposes are:


It seems to me that these questions more properly fall into the
category of ""general metaphysics"". I would prefer any misc.taoism
to deal more closely with topics and works more closely associated
with at least ""semi-orthodox"" Taoism: with established classic works 
definitely included and works like Mantak Chia's argued about! 

I think ""neo-Taoism"" should be excluded or get its own group (what I
mean by this is ""Humpty-Dumpty Taoism"", in which Taoism means whatever 
a poster says it means.) This ""alt.taoism"" could also be a refuge 
for debates about what ""Taoism *REALLY* means"" or speculations on sexual
alchemy, etc..

e.g. (from Thyagi again):

Kent gloomily predicts (quoting from Thyagi's article):


I think that discussions of this nature are not completely out of
place. What's happening is that that the term ""Taoism"" is becoming
completely polluted and trivialized like the words ""magic"", ""Alchemy"", 
""Zen,"" etc., by writers appropriating the word to mean whatever they 
want. This is seen by the spate of new age books entitled ""The
Tao of"" this, that, and everything else. (With respect to some exceptions
like the books by Jou, Tsung-Hwa.)

Any other comments/ideas? I look forward to seeing them. On balance,
I say let misc.taoism rip and let the chips fall where they may. If
it just gets filled up with college freshmen asking about the
Tao of Sex then it will have been a failure and people will post to
these groups just as they do now.

Vulcan as a planet inside Mercury was hypothesized to explain a perturbation

"I need information on the Display PostScript strokeadjust feature.
This feature adjusts the endpoints of lines so that the displayed line
looks better on low resolution devices.

The PostScript literature explains the process to some extent.  They
also give an example of how to ""emulate"" strokeadjust in PostScript
environments where it is absent.

The suggested emulation is to modify the coordinates of the endpoints
of a line using the following formula for each coordinate:

	new_coord = (round (old_coord - 0.25)) + 0.25
	
Doing this we end up with all coordinates ending in "".25"".  From
reading I thought that what they might actually do is:

	new_coord = ((trunc (old_coord * 2)) / 2) + 0.25
	
This results in all the coordinates ending in either ""0.25"" or ""0.75"" 
whichever is closer.

By doing some actual comparisons with Display PostScript, I find that
neither of these is what DPS really uses.  Since I like how the DPS
result looks better than how my stuff looks, I'd like to know if
anyone who knows how DPS does it is willing/able to tell me.

Here's the real problem.  Americans have become so insensitive to the needs
of others and so completely wrapped up in themselves that they cannot see
straight or think clearly enough to make even the slightest and most obvious
moral decisions based on reality.

If a man abandons a woman to care for their child on her own, he is not
considered to be a very respectable or decent man by anyone.  This man has
fled his responsibility, has behaved like a lazy coward, and has turned
away from his responsibility to his wife and child.

However, if a woman decides to kill her unborn child to release her burden,
she is not thought of in the same way.  When the man abandons, the woman
suffers but the child is free to grow up and live a happy and normal life.
When the woman abandons, the child is diced or killed with saline or vacuumed
out, and the man has no choice, and the man sometimes suffers so badly that
he wishes he could trade places with his child.

Ths root of this whole problem is selfishness--the arrogance that says, ""My
feelings and desires are supreme and your well being is not worth dung.""
And when you come down to it, this is the substance of what hell is made of.
It's the reason a loving God can throw selfish people to the devil and his
demons for all of eternity.  Let any one of us unrepentant into heaven, and
we'll ruin it the first chance we get.

: Now, I don't really know the answer to these questions, but I've got a real
: good guess.
: 

And, it's probably right.

: And I wouldn't call *that* 'benevolent', either.
: 

It is a move in the right direction.  As it is now, we don't see our
responsibility because we kill it and get it out of sight.  The media
backs us completely.  Real responsibility does not sell.  The only
""responsibility"" that sells in the marketplace is that which is just
enough to make us ""feel responsible"" without showing anything that
might show us our own true irresponsibility.  We want to ""feel"" like
good people, but we want nothing with *being* good people.  Just give
me the freedom to say ""I'm good"", and the rest of the world can burn.
Rape and kill my children and throw my parents to the places where
poor old folks rot until they're dead.  I'll hate my brother and sister
if I wish and I'll cheat on my wife or husband.  Screw the government,
because it screws me, and don't talk to me about giving to the church
because church people are all a bunch of money grubbing hypocrites.
But, I'm a good person.  At least I admit what I do.  At least I love
myself and we all know that is the greatest love in the world--not that
a man lay down his life for his brother...That sounds too ""christian"".

At the root, this is the substance of what hell is made of.

We've become a self indulgant, backslidden society no longer responsible
to our children, to our parents, to our families, to our government, or
to our God.  This is the root behind justification of every evil, of every
corruption in government, of every slanderous remark, of every lie, and
of every murder.  Society cannot continue to live like this long.  it will
have to destroy itsself soon, and perhaps in the end, that will be the
biggest blessing this world can hope to see.

Why do people see so much evil in trying to turn this situation around?

It certainly is provable.  Around a million Americans every year defend
themselves with firearms.  In many of these cases the defender doesn't even

I don't like violence anymore than anyone else does.  But, taking away the
right of Americans to keep and bear arms is not the solution to the violent
crime problem in this country.  If honest, law-abiding citizens are unable
to get firearms then they will be preyed on even more by criminals who will
be able to acquire guns through illegal channels.  Expect to start seeing
the crime syndicates who smuggle drugs into this country start smuggling
guns.  Believe me this will happen.  There is *plenty* of economic
incentive for gangsters to illegaly import guns into this country if guns
should be banned by the Klintonistas.

"Let me begin by saying I think this is the world's first religion to use
the net as its major recruitment medium.  Therefore, even if this
religion does not take off, its founding members will be very important
historically as this method of soliciting membership will eventually become 
common.

The basis of this religion is to apply various aspects of current conventional
morality to the characters in Genesis and Exodus but assume that the Bible's
accounts of the facts and historical events is correct.

For example,

Story of Adam and Eve:
Adam and Eve are in Garden of Eden naked and ignorant.  Have unlimited
supply of food provided, but no clothing, jobs, or knowledge.  God says
not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide 
in bushes.  God finds them and forces them out of Garden.
(There are several different stories on what they were doing while naked in
the bushes that might have angered God.)

Traditional Philosophy:
1. The only reason you need knowledge or a job is to eat.  If someone else will
provide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemployed and it's OK. This
is why married women usually didn't work until recent decades.
2. Authority figures, such as God, whoever was behind the Vietnam War, Hitler 
and slaveowners, are always right and should be blindly followed without 
question by ordinary people, who can't make decisions for themselves.

Interpretation of events based on Traditional Philosophy:
They were not supposed to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God
told them to.  Like small children, they had their needs provided for and were
obligated to do whatever their ""Father"" said to.  Being forced to leave the 
Garden and work in order to obtain food was a punishment.

Lessons from Traditional Interpretation:
1.  Ignorance is good.  Knowledge is bad, but tempting.
2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read ""welfare"") is ideal.  Get-
ting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn is punishment.
3.  Public nudity is good.  Covering up is bad.
4.  Authority figures are intrinsically right.  Normal people are dumb and 
should do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for 
themselves.
5.  People in subordinate positions are especially obligated to refrain from
learning.  For example, it should be illegal for slaves to learn to read.

1990's philosophy:
1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unless
named ""Hillary Clinton"" or ""Murphy Brown"".
2.  People should use common sense.  They should not kill other people 
(binding of Issac, wars, Holocaust, etc.) just because they are told to.

Interpretation of events based on current philosophy:
They were supposed to eat the fruit.  God gave wanted them to seek knowledge
rather than be handed it on a silver platter.  Once they had gained knowledge
and (by seeking it) showed their ability to make mature decisions for them-
selves, they no longer needed to be treated like little children and were 
REWARDED by being allowed into the ""real world.""

Lessons from new interpretation:
1.  Ignorance is bad.  Knowledge is good, but must be sought.
2.  Having food provided for you for nothing (read ""welfare"") is at best
a temporary measure.  Getting a job and feeding yourself with what you earn
is ideal.
3.  Public nudity is bad.  Covering up is good.
4.  Authority figures are often wrong.  Normal people are intelligent and
should consider whether the instructions are really a good idea and ""alter
or abolish"" bad governments.  They should think for themselves.
5.  People in subordinate decisions are often discouraged from knowledge
but should seek it anyway, and all the harder.  For example, poor children 
without good schools should work especially hard in order to make a better
life for their children (and themselves).

I have tentatively named this new philosophy ""The Church of Eveism"" because
Eve's decision to eat the apple is man[sic]kind's first good decision, instead
of its first bad one, as traditionally believed.  She is therefore clearly
a protagonist.  God at first appears evil, for telling people not to seek 
knowledge but on deeper analysis is also a protagonist.  As God rewarded the
decision to defy him, and provided the tree in the first place, the intention
and desire were clearly to have the knowledge be obtained, but to delay it 
until it was actively sought.

This algorithm works well for me:

Algorithm to attempt to find outward-facing normals:
---------------------------------------------------
First, mark all faces as UNKNOWN.

Then create an edge dictionary that allows you to find all of the
faces sharing a given edge (where an edge is two integers representing
the two shared vertices).

Pick an arbitrary face and mark it COUNTER_CLOCKWISE.  Using the edge
dictionary, orient all surrounding faces based on the orientation of
this face.  And recurse for all surrounding faces, consistently
orienting the entire surface.

Find the average of the vertices in this surface.  Using that point,
calculate a volume measurement, taking into account the face's
orientation.  If the volume turns out to be positive, assume the faces
are oriented correctly.  If it is negative, reverse their orientations
(mark them CLOCKWISE).

If any faces are still UNKNOWN after this, choose another face
and go through the algorithm again.

At the end, faces marked CLOCKWISE must have their indices reversed
before facet normals are found.

(Note: if you are running on Silicon Graphics machines and buy the
IRIS Inventor 3D toolkit developers package you have the source to
this algorithm-- see /usr/src/Inventor/tools/ivnorm/.  If you're
not... sorry, I can't give out the source, and even if I could it

SEI Level 5 (the highest level -- the SEI stands for Software
Engineering Institute).  I'm not sure, but I believe that this rating
only applies to the flight software.  Also keep in mind that it was
*not* achieved through the use of sophisticated tools, but rather
through a 'brute force and ignorance' attack on the problem during the
Challenger standdown - they simply threw hundreds of people at it and
did the whole process by hand.  I would not consider receiving a 'Warning'
status on systems which are not yet in use would detract much (if
anything) from such a rating -- I'll have to get the latest copy of
the guidelines to make sure (they just issued new ones, I think).

Also keep in mind that the SEI levels are concerned primarily with
control of the software process; the assumption is that a
well controlled process will produce good software.  Also keep in mind
that SEI Level 5 is DAMNED HARD.  Most software in this country is
produced by 'engineering practicies' that only rate an SEI Level 1 (if
that).

OpenGL is a graphics programming library and as such is a great, portable
interface for the development of interactive 3D graphics applications. It
is not, however, an indicator of performance, as that will vary strongly
from machine to machine and vendor to vendor.  SGI is committed to high
performance interactive graphics systems and software tools, so OpenGL
means that you can port easily from SGI to other platforms, there is no
guarantee that your performance would be comparable.


If your sales representative truly mislead you, then you should have a
valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local SGI
sales management team. Feel free to contact the local branch manager...we
understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers, so give it a
shot.


As one of the previous posts stated, the Personal IRIS was introduced in
1988 and grew to include the 4D/20, 4D/25, 4D/30 and 4D/35 as clock rates
sped up over time. As a rule of thumb, SGI platforms live for about 4-5
years. This was true of the motorola-based 3000 series ('85-'89), the PI
('88-'93), the Professional Series (the early 4D's - '86-'90), the Power
Series parallel systems ('88-'93). Individual CPU subsystems running at a
particular clock rate usually live for about 2 years. New graphics
architectures at the high end (GT, VGX, RealityEngine) are released every
18 months to 2 years.

These are the facts of life.  If we look at these machines, they become
almost archaic after four years, and we have to come out with a new
platform (like Indigo, Onyx, Challenge) which has higher bus bandwidths,
faster CPUs, faster graphics and I/O, and larger disk capacities. If we
don't, we become uncompetitive.

From the user perspective, you have to buy a machine that meets your
current needs and makes economic sense today.  You can't wait to buy, but
if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine, ask the Sales Rep
for one in writing. If it's feasible, they should be able to do that. Some
of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them, such as
the Performance Protection Program for older R3000-based Power Series
multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain
a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new Onyx or Challenge
R4400-based 64-bit multiprocessor systems.


If that's happening, it's becausing of misunderstandings or
mis-communication, not because SGI is directly attempting to annoy our
customer base.


Most SGI customers are onesy-twosey types, but regardless, we rarely give a
great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because
again, like a previous post stated, if we pre-announced and the schedule
slipped, we would mess up our potential customers schedules (when they were
counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date) and
would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial
analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our
commitments.


Five years is an awfully long time in computer years. New processor
technologies are arriving every 1-2 years, making a 5 year old computer at
least 2 and probably 3 generations behind the times. The competitive nature
of the market is demanding that rate of development, so if your timing is
really 5 years between purchases, you have to accept the limited viability
of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor.

There are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live
with, but keeping customers happy is the most important, so don't give up,
we know it.

"Tony-

I read your post, it was nothing new, I had seen much the same in other
typical""Christian"" anti-gay sentimental literature.  Gay people are and will
con- tinue to be persecuted as long as such propaganda petpetuates.  You may
be unaware of all the statistica ""findings"" concerning African-Americans that
have been published and used by various groups to re-enforce their own bias
against African-Americans.  We usually think of the KKK in these instances,
but there are many other groups.  Of course, the vast majority of the public
scoff at such findings and documents today, but that was not always the case.
Fortunately African-Americans had ""whites"" who supported their 'cause' and
public sentiment was eventually (if not entirely) turned around.  There was
even a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increased.  In fact, until laws
were put in place to protect the inalienable rights of Blacks it was pretty
much legal to discriminate against them.

I know many gays and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free
form discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceived or something,
that is your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)
openly affirms the rights of oppressed people of all segments of society,
including gays.  We believe the Gospel message of preaching to all creation
and making disciples.  We believe in the Lord's great commandment to Love,
and we beleive in standing up for the oppressed, even if it is not popular
to do so.  I really like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a
church almost anywhere in the valley that stands for the Gospel and believes
in the commandment of Love (though I'm hard-pressed to find many who actually
sho Love), but not many are willing to champion the oppressed, especially
within their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian
community for the unpopularity of my beliefs, but so did the abolitionists
against the oppression of African-Americans.  Many were even killed and
treated as runaway slaves for being ""nigger-lovers"" and such.  I guess I've
decided the challenge is worth it.

In my talks with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic
story centering around failed marriages, wives and husbands who are straight
who have been hurt in the process, etc.  Funny thing is, I don't know of one
case where the parents, ex-wives, or even children have continued to reject
their gay family member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they
began to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.

I'm apalled by the legislation which passed in Colorado, and am equally out0
raged that such slimey people as Louis Sheldon (from the Tradition Values
Coalition) have been actively working in the Christian underground to garner
support within several (8 I believe) states this coming November for more
oppressive legisation against gays.

Perhaps you don't get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn't get it in the
Middle Ages and the proclaimed God's will be done as they massacred thousands
in witch hunts and inquisitions.

The message that comes through, loud and clear, by proponents against gay
rights and against gays in general, is that there is a strong dislike, even
hatred for gays, whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn't change
the results).  The major flaw in all this posturing is that in the end, the
final effect of posts like that of yours and Mr. Hudson is that YOU have a
""conditional"" love for gays.  Condition:  Change and we'll love you. This is
sure strange coming from a group who claim that God has an ""unconditional""
love, one that calls people ""just as they are.""  Sure there are things that
will 'naturally' change, and habits (like alcoholism, wife beating, etc.) that
need to be changed through some sort of therapy.  But then there are things
like left-handedness, etc. that no amount of beating it out of people, is
going to result in anything more than an outward conforminty to ""other
people's expectations."" In the process this coerced conformity causes many
people a great deal of harm, especially when it is caused by people who have
nothing more to gain from it that to become even more puffed up about their
own sense of pseuper-spirituality.

This is sad, but I thoroughly believe that one day it will change.  It may be
unpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basis has to do with
something very personal like 'sexuality' (a taboo subject even today), but I
firmly believe in the rights of individuals to be free from impose regulation
on thier bedrooms.  It's funny that most straight people have successfully
removed restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,
but we like to maintain this little chestnut of repression...as though it
helps us maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.
Gay people are not criminals.

Another interesting thing happened recently.  A very prominent charismatic
church in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it's pastors arrested for self-
admitted charges of pederasty (men having sex with boys).  This had apparently
been going on for some time (a couple years?), but since the charges were
voluntary, and the church worked closely with the police, so I imagine that
was how they managed to downplay it in the media.  How could such a thing
happen when the church, itself, has an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friends
recently told me he was ""approached"" by someone who is going through the
reparitive therapy there, and he was thoroughly convinced that the request for
dinner was not an invitation to attend the ministry.

These are difficult times we live in, but providing hostile environments and
creating and perpetuating an atmosphere that breed hate and violence is not
the call of the Christian community.  The results of the passing amendment in
Colorado has created an organization who's posters are appearing all over
Colorado called ""S.T.R.A.I.G.H.T."" (I forget the whole definition off hand,
but the last part was Against Immoral Gross Homosexual Trash) and their motto
is ""Working for a fag-free America"" with an implicit advocation for violence.

This is sick, and it seems to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and others are
embracing.

We Christians have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression
towards those we feel don't 'measure up', and constant beratement from
organizations like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good
purpose also, their major work seems to be finding new and better ways of
excluding people.

The Gospel I believe is not so negative, rather it seeks ways to ""include""
people.  I have several of Dr. Martin's books and find them quite helpful,
especially concerning 'cults.' But it seems that CRI, has become a cult unto
itself.  Why don't we just stick to the positive and find ways to bring people
to Jesus istead of taking bullwhips and driving them away?

This means you would support a ban if it were narrow enough.  Good.


I would hope so.  Let's define a nuclear weapon as an explosive weapon
whose majority of energy comes from fission and/or fusion of atomic
nuclei.  Let's define a biological weapon as live organisms or viruses 
in such state, quantity, and with such a vector that they could cause 
death or serious disease [further defined] to a significant number of
people if released in a city, similarly populated area, resevoir, or
cropland.  


Nerve gas and mustard gas are well defined.  Other poisonous
gasses should be individually banned only if it can be shown that there
is no use not related to weaponry.  Licenses should be available for
research purposes on such chemicals.

I am not a lawyer, but these ideas could certainly be a basis for 
definitions.


Nope.  It is not considered a weapon.


It is not defined as a weapon of mass destruction.  Many things are

Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. [Honestly.]
The word of Sin is Restriction. [Would I kid you?]


Does one man's words encompass the majestic vision of thousands
of individuals?  Quoting a man is not the same as quoting the
Order.  Taken out of context, words can be interpreted much
differently than had one applied them within the confines of
their original expression.

I think this is the case regarding Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior 
of the Order to which I belong.  When he included that bit
from Merlinus X' he did us all a service.  He showed us the extremes
to which Order members have been known to go in their fervor.
I have little knowledge regarding Reuss' background, but surely
he was an unusual man, and he was an important force in the Order 
for many years.

Yet as people change so do Orders change, and while we look back
so carefully at the dirty laundry of O.T.O. remember that this is
only the surface skim and that many perspectives are now encompassed
which extend beyond any one individual.  I hope to show that there
was and is much room for a difference of opinion within the Order
itself, perhaps by testing the limits myself.


Let us examine this issue a bit more closely....

""In 1895, Karl Kellner (1850-1905), a wealthy Austrian industrialist
and paper chemist, as well as a high-grade Mason, founded the Ordo
Templi Orientis.  Kellner had traveled widely in the East, where he
met three adepts who instructed him specific magical practices.  
Kellner's efforts to develop the Order were later assisted by Franz
Hartmann, Heinrich Klein and Theodore Reuss, who had worked together
prior to joining the O.T.O.  The Order was first proclaimed in 1902
in Reuss's Masonic publication, 'Oriflamme'.  On Kellner's death,
Reuss succeeded him as Outer Head [O.H.O.].  The 'Jubilee' edition of
the 'Oriflamme', published in 1912, announced that the Order taught
secret of sexual magic.
 
""Theodore Reuss was an interesting character.  Born June 28, 1855 in
Augsburg, he entered Masonry in 1876.  He was a singer, journalist and
possibly a spy for the Prussian political police, infiltrating the Socialist
League founded by Karl Marx's daughter and her husband.  Reuss was
later associated with William Wynn Westcott, a leader of the Golden
Dawn, who later introduced him to John Yarker.  Yarker chartered Reuss to
found the Rites of Memphis and Mizraim in Germany.  After several
attempts to concretize various Masonic Rites, Reuss settled on the
development of the O.T.O.

""The Order experienced reasonably steady growth under Reuss' leadership.
For example, he chartered Papus in France, Rudolph Steiner in Berlin
and H. Spencer Lewis in the USA.  In 1912, the historic meeting between
Reuss and Crowley occurred.  Crowley wrote that Reuss came to him and
accused him of revealing Order secrets.  When Crowley looked at it afresh,
the initiated interpretation of sexual magick unfolded itself to him for
the first time.  Reuss appointed Crowley as Supreme and Holy King of all
the English speaking world, and it was this authorization that he invoked
when publishing the material of the Equinox.

""Reuss resigned as Outer Head of the Order in 1922 after suffering a
stroke and named Crowley his successor.  All was well until 1925 when
_The Book of the Law_ was translated into German.  There was a break
in the continuity of the Order.  Manyk members split with the new O.H.O.
over the book, which Crowley was actively promulgating through the Order.
He had earlier revise dthe Order rituals at Reuss's request, deeply
infusing the doctrines of the New Aeon revelation.""

_An Introduction to the History of the O.T.O._, by Ad Veritatem IX'

Within _Equinox III:10_, Edited by 
  Hymenaeus Beta, Frater Superior, Rex Summus Sanctissimus,
    Caliph of the United States of America,
      Published by Samuel Weiser, 1990.



There are many possible reasons that our Frater Superior included this
material in _Equinox III:10_.  And this is the real point, is it not?
Why did he wish to publish such things about the history of his own
organization?  Does he represent a dogmatic threat to the principle
of Thelema?  Or is he exercising his True Will and putting forth very
complex pictures with no easy answers?  A picture which leaves room
for very many interpretations.

It is quite easy for me to see, for example, that all of O.T.O. derived
out of the dribble of faltering Masonry, purchased by clever hucksters
with an ounce of courage and some writing ability to aid them.  And I
can take that all the way down to our present Caliph, whose feeble
support of the 'Law of Thelema' is laughable at best.

Would I be thrown out of the Order for speaking in this way?  
Will I?  
I think not.
Why?  Because my Frater will see it as a perspective, an interjection
I am using as an example.  My illustration shows that we may express things
in the context of a larger work and the true significance of this may be
quite difficult to apprehend at first.

So it may be with OTO and Merlinus X'.  Please look O.T.O. more carefully.
I do not support Reuss's words myself, as I am not qualified to assess
them, and I am critical of their pomposity.  If I who am a member of
the Order take such a stand and am allowed to continue doing so, then
what can this say about the health of the Order?  Does it mean that
the Order has 'gone soft' and abandoned its moral principles?  Or
does it mean that it is strong in its ability to let the will of
universal kinship arise on its own, not shackled by some dogmatic
requirement?  How shall we resolve these two possibilities?


I find a high calibre of individual associated with Ordo Templi Orientis.
They are often quite intelligent and sometimes very well versed in arcane
or usual information.  They are quite often artists and geniuses.  
Having met some 20 longstanding members in the SF Bay Area (many who are or
were very heavily involved with the Order), I can vouch for the integrity
of the organization as it stands.

I have sometimes questioned the policy of Hymenaeus Beta.  In these moments 
I followed my intuition, and I've found little to stop me from requesting
a Second initiation from a different O.T.O. body.  I'm happily participating
in social groups (Feasts or Initiations) and have come to know the Gnostic
Mass well enough for my tastes.
 

This doesn't make me an authority on Order politics and explanations, however.
I can only hypothesize and relay to you what I understand based on my
limited contact with other members.

I urge you not to take the words of Merlinus X too far.  There are many
ways to interpret words, and many people who have become involved with
the Order feel very strongly about the sanctity of personal freedom
and the preservation of individual vision.

I welcome other comment on this issue and will be writing more in response
to other posts in this thread.

I wondered the same thing.  When he first mentioned it, I thought he was
just making a mistake but then he said it over and over.  And then in the
examples from other years, he gave stats for players from both leagues even
when only one league expanded.

So (since stats *NEVER* lie :-) ), I guess there is an effect on both leagues
because the expansion draft takes talent from both leagues equally making 
every team in both leagues dilute their major league talent by calling up

more civilized, when all it really does is make us all sheep. They 
would rather wallow in their pitiful liberal white guilt about how
society has driven the criminal to rob, rape, and murder. They 
support spending millions of public dollars protecting the rights of scum
who have already demonstrated that they have no regard for society
or its laws. They ignore the fact that areas with the strictest gun
control (NYC,DC) have the worst crime and areas with little gun
control (VT,NH,ID) have very little crime in comparison. But they
have to ignore this because otherwise they would need to confront
the fact that law-abiding citizens who own guns are not the ones that
are causing most of the trouble in society. Oh no, we certainly can't
accept that! But I guess I have faith that when crime starts making
significant inroads into their neighborhoods and starts directly
hurting them and their families, they will probably whistle a different
tune. They just better hope it isn't too late then.

"LARSONIAN Astronomy and Physics

               Orthodox physicists, astronomers, and astrophysicists 
          CLAIM to be looking for a ""Unified Field Theory"" in which all 
          of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single 
          set of laws or equations.  But they have been systematically 
          IGNORING or SUPPRESSING an excellent one for 30 years! 

               The late Physicist Dewey B. Larson's comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, which he 
          calls the ""Reciprocal System"", is built on two fundamental 
          postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of 
          space and time: 
    
               (1) ""The physical universe is composed ENTIRELY of ONE 
          component, MOTION, existing in THREE dimensions, in DISCRETE 
          UNITS, and in two RECIPROCAL forms, SPACE and TIME."" 
    
               (2) ""The physical universe conforms to the relations of 
          ORDINARY COMMUTATIVE mathematics, its magnitudes are 
          ABSOLUTE, and its geometry is EUCLIDEAN."" 
    
               From these two postulates, Larson developed a COMPLETE 
          Theoretical Universe, using various combinations of 
          translational, vibrational, rotational, and vibrational-
          rotational MOTIONS, the concepts of IN-ward and OUT-ward 
          SCALAR MOTIONS, and speeds in relation to the Speed of Light 
          (which Larson called ""UNIT VELOCITY"" and ""THE NATURAL 
          DATUM""). 
      
               At each step in the development, Larson was able to 
          MATCH objects in his Theoretical Universe with objects in the 
          REAL physical universe, (photons, sub-atomic particles 
          [INCOMPLETE ATOMS], charges, atoms, molecules, globular star 
          clusters, galaxies, binary star systems, solar systems, white 
          dwarf stars, pulsars, quasars, ETC.), even objects NOT YET 
          DISCOVERED THEN (such as EXPLODING GALAXIES, and GAMMA-RAY 
          BURSTS). 
          
               And applying his Theory to his NEW model of the atom, 
          Larson was able to precisely and accurately CALCULATE inter-
          atomic distances in crystals and molecules, compressibility 
          and thermal expansion of solids, and other properties of 
          matter. 

               All of this is described in good detail, with-OUT fancy 
          complex mathematics, in his books.

          organization that was started to promote Larson's Theory.  
          They have other related publications, including the quarterly 
          journal ""RECIPROCITY"". 

          

          Physicist Dewey B. Larson's Background
    
               Physicist Dewey B. Larson was a retired Engineer 
          (Chemical or Electrical).  He was about 91 years old when he 
          died in May 1989.  He had a Bachelor of Science Degree in 
          Engineering Science from Oregon State University.  He 
          developed his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe while trying to develop a way to COMPUTE 
          chemical properties based only on the elements used. 
    
               Larson's lack of a fancy ""PH.D."" degree might be one 
          reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him, but it is 
          NOT A VALID REASON.  Sometimes it takes a relative outsider 
          to CLEARLY SEE THE FOREST THROUGH THE TREES.  At the same 
          time, it is clear from his books that he also knew ORTHODOX 
          physics and astronomy as well as ANY physicist or astronomer, 
          well enough to point out all their CONTRADICTIONS, AD HOC 
          ASSUMPTIONS, PRINCIPLES OF IMPOTENCE, IN-CONSISTENCIES, ETC.. 
     
               Larson did NOT have the funds, etc. to experimentally 
          test his Theory.  And it was NOT necessary for him to do so.  
          He simply compared the various parts of his Theory with OTHER 
          researchers' experimental and observational data.  And in 
          many cases, HIS explanation FIT BETTER. 
    
               A SELF-CONSISTENT Theory is MUCH MORE than the ORTHODOX 
          physicists and astronomers have!  They CLAIM to be looking 
          for a ""unified field theory"" that works, but have been 
          IGNORING one for over 30 years now! 
    
               ""Modern physics"" does NOT explain the physical universe 
          so well.  Some parts of some of Larson's books are FULL of 
          quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who 
          agree.  And remember that ""epicycles"", ""crystal spheres"", 
          ""geocentricity"", ""flat earth theory"", etc., ALSO once SEEMED 
          to explain it well, but were later proved CONCEPTUALLY WRONG. 
    
    
               Prof. Frank H. Meyer, Professor Emeritus of UW-Superior, 
          was/is a STRONG PROPONENT of Larson's Theory, and was (or 
          still is) President of Larson's organization, ""THE 
          INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNIFIED SCIENCE"", and Editor of 
          their quarterly Journal ""RECIPROCITY"".  He moved to 
          Minneapolis after retiring. 
    


          ""Super Collider"" BOONDOGGLE!
          
               I am AGAINST contruction of the ""Superconducting Super 
          Collider"", in Texas or anywhere else.  It would be a GROSS 
          WASTE of money, and contribute almost NOTHING of ""scientific"" 
          value. 
    
               Most physicists don't realize it, but, according to the 
          comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the late Physicist 
          Dewey B. Larson, as described in his books, the strange GOOFY 
          particles (""mesons"", ""hyperons"", ALLEGED ""quarks"", etc.) 
          which they are finding in EXISTING colliders (Fermi Lab, 
          Cern, etc.) are really just ATOMS of ANTI-MATTER, which are 
          CREATED by the high-energy colliding beams, and which quickly 
          disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible 
          with their environment. 
    
               A larger and more expensive collider will ONLY create a 
          few more elements of anti-matter that the physicists have not 
          seen there before, and the physicists will be EVEN MORE 
          CONFUSED THAN THEY ARE NOW! 
    
               Are a few more types of anti-matter atoms worth the $8.3 
          BILLION cost?!!  Don't we have much more important uses for 
          this WASTED money?! 
    
     
               Another thing to consider is that the primary proposed 
          location in Texas has a serious and growing problem with some 
          kind of ""fire ants"" eating the insulation off underground 
          cables.  How much POISONING of the ground and ground water 
          with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of 
          the ""Supercollider""?! 
    
          
               Naming the ""Super Collider"" after Ronald Reagon, as 
          proposed, is TOTALLY ABSURD!  If it is built, it should be 
          named after a leading particle PHYSICIST. 
      


          LARSONIAN Anti-Matter
          
               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe, anti-matter is NOT a simple case of 
          opposite charges of the same types of particles.  It has more 
          to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the 
          photons of which they are made, in relation to the 
          vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light, 
          which Larson calls ""Unit Velocity"" and the ""Natural Datum"". 
     
               In Larson's Theory, a positron is actually a particle of 
          MATTER, NOT anti-matter.  When a positron and electron meet, 
          the rotational vibrations (charges) and rotations of their 
          respective photons (of which they are made) neutralize each 
          other. 
      
               In Larson's Theory, the ANTI-MATTER half of the physical 
          universe has THREE dimensions of TIME, and ONLY ONE dimension 
          of space, and exists in a RECIPROCAL RELATIONSHIP to our 
          MATERIAL half. 
       


          LARSONIAN Relativity
          
               The perihelion point in the orbit of the planet Mercury 
          has been observed and precisely measured to ADVANCE at the 
          rate of 574 seconds of arc per century.  531 seconds of this 
          advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational 
          perturbations from the other planets (Venus, Earth, Jupiter, 
          etc.).  The remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to 
          help ""prove"" Einstein's ""General Theory of Relativity"". 
    
               But the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson achieved results 
          CLOSER to the 43 seconds than ""General Relativity"" can, by 
          INSTEAD using ""SPECIAL Relativity"".  In one or more of his 
          books, he applied the LORENTZ TRANSFORMATION on the HIGH 
          ORBITAL SPEED of Mercury. 
    
               Larson TOTALLY REJECTED ""General Relativity"" as another 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASY.  He also REJECTED most of ""Special 
          Relativity"", including the parts about ""mass increases"" near 
          the speed of light, and the use of the Lorentz Transform on 
          doppler shifts, (Those quasars with red-shifts greater than 
          1.000 REALLY ARE MOVING FASTER THAN THE SPEED OF LIGHT, 
          although most of that motion is away from us IN TIME.). 
     
               In Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the 
          physical universe, there are THREE dimensions of time instead 
          of only one.  But two of those dimensions can NOT be measured 
          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one 
          dimension that we CAN measure is the CLOCK time.  At low 
          relative speeds, the values of the other two dimensions are 
          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high speeds, they become significant, and 
          the Lorentz Transformation must be used as a FUDGE FACTOR. 
          [Larson often used the term ""COORDINATE TIME"" when writing 
          about this.] 
    
     
               In regard to ""mass increases"", it has been PROVEN in 
          atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near 
          the speed of light.  But the formula for acceleration is 
          ACCELERATION = FORCE / MASS, (a = F/m).  Orthodox physicists 
          are IGNORING the THIRD FACTOR: FORCE.  In Larson's Theory, 
          mass STAYS CONSTANT and FORCE drops toward zero.  FORCE is 
          actually a MOTION, or COMBINATIONS of MOTIONS, or RELATIONS 
          BETWEEN MOTIONS, including INward and OUTward SCALAR MOTIONS.  
          The expansion of the universe, for example, is an OUTward 
          SCALAR motion inherent in the universe and NOT a result of 
          the so-called ""Big Bang"" (which is yet another MATHEMATICAL 
          FANTASY). 
    
                                    
          
          THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION

               I wish to recommend to EVERYONE the book ""THE UNIVERSE 
          OF MOTION"", by Dewey B. Larson, 1984, North Pacific 
          Publishers, (P.O. Box 13255, Portland, Oregon  97213), 456 
          pages, indexed, hardcover. 
    
               It contains the Astrophysical portions of a GENERAL 
          UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by that 
          author, an UNrecognized GENIUS, more than thirty years ago. 
    
               It contains FINAL SOLUTIONS to most ALL Astrophysical 
          mysteries, including the FORMATION of galaxies, binary and 
          multiple star systems, and solar systems, the TRUE ORIGIN of 
          the ""3-degree"" background radiation, cosmic rays, and gamma-
          ray bursts, and the TRUE NATURE of quasars, pulsars, white 
          dwarfs, exploding galaxies, etc.. 
    
               It contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are ALL 
          looking for, if they are ready to seriously consider it with 
          OPEN MINDS! 
    
               The following is an example of his Theory's success: 
          In his first book in 1959, ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL 
          UNIVERSE"", Larson predicted the existence of EXPLODING 
          GALAXIES, several years BEFORE astronomers started finding 
          them.  They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson's 
          comprehensive Theory.  And when QUASARS were discovered, he 
          had an immediate related explanation for them also. 
    

 
          GAMMA-RAY BURSTS

               Astro-physicists and astronomers are still scratching 
          their heads about the mysterious GAMMA-RAY BURSTS.  They were 
          originally thought to originate from ""neutron stars"" in the 
          disc of our galaxy.  But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in 
          Earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions 
          uniformly, and their source locations in space do NOT 
          correspond to any known objects, (except for a few cases of 
          directional coincidence). 
    
               Gamma-ray bursts are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe developed by 
          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson.  According to page 386 of 
          his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", published in 1984, the 
          gamma-ray bursts are coming from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSIONS in the 
          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson calls 
          the ""Cosmic Sector"".  Because of the relationship between the 
          anti-matter and material halves of the physical universe, and 
          the way they are connected together, the gamma-ray bursts can 
          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seemingly at 
          random.  (This is WHY the source locations of the bursts do 
          not correspond with known objects, and come from all 
          directions uniformly.) 
    
               I wonder how close to us in space a source location 
          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most 
          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to 
          stop it! 
    
               Perhaps some of the MASS EXTINCTIONS of the past, which 
          are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids, were 
          actually caused by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURSTS! 
    


          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation
          
               About half of all the stars in the galaxy in the 
          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox 
          astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory 
          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. 
    
               But binary star systems are actually a LIKELY 
          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of 
          the physical universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey 
          B. Larson. 
    
               I will try to summarize Larsons explanation, which is 
          detailed in Chapter 7 of his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"" 
          and in some of his other books. 
    
               First of all, according to Larson, stars do NOT generate 
          energy by ""fusion"".  A small fraction comes from slow 
          gravitational collapse.  The rest results from the COMPLETE 
          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY elements (heavier than IRON).  Each 
          element has a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the 
          element is, the lower is this limit.  A star's internal 
          temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and 
          absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays, gradually 
          reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and 
          lighter elements. 
    
               When the internal temperature of the star reaches the 
          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there is a Type I 
          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  This is because there is SO MUCH iron 
          present; and that is related to the structure of iron atoms 
          and the atom building process, which Larson explains in some 
          of his books [better than I can]. 
    
               When the star explodes, the lighter material on the 
          outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less 
          than the speed of light.  The heavier material in the center 
          portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to 
          the speed of light, because of the high temperature.  The 
          explosion pushes that material OVER the speed of light, and 
          it expands OUTWARD IN TIME, which is equivalent to INWARD IN 
          SPACE, and it often actually DISAPPEARS for a while. 
    
               Over long periods of time, both masses start to fall 
          back gravitationally.  The material that had been blown 
          outward in space now starts to form a RED GIANT star.  The 
          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME starts to form a 
          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH stars then start moving back toward 
          the ""MAIN SEQUENCE"" from opposite directions on the H-R 
          Diagram. 
    
               The chances of the two masses falling back into the 
          exact same location in space, making a single lone star 
          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY 
          system, orbiting each other. 
     
               According to Larson, a white dwarf star has an INVERSE 
          DENSITY GRADIENT (is densest at its SURFACE), because the 
          material at its center is most widely dispersed (blown 
          outward) in time.   This ELIMINATES the need to resort to 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES about ""degenerate matter"", ""neutron 
          stars"", ""black holes"", etc.. 
    


          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation

               If the mass of the heavy material at the center of the 
          exploding star is relatively SMALL, then, instead of a single 
          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL ""mini"" white dwarf 
          stars (revolving around the red giant star, but probably 
          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affected 
          by its heat, etc.).  These will become PLANETS! 
      
               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson used all 
          this information, and other principles of his comprehensive 
          GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical universe, to derive 
          his own version of Bode's Law. 
          


          ""Black Hole"" FANTASY!

               I heard that physicist Stephen W. Hawking recently 
          completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of TWO ""black 
          holes"" merging together into a SINGLE ""black hole"", and 
          concluded that the new ""black hole"" would have MORE MASS than 
          the sum of the two original ""black holes"". 
    
               Such a result should be recognized by EVERYone as a RED 
          FLAG, causing widespread DOUBT about the whole IDEA of ""black 
          holes"", etc.! 
    
               After reading Physicist Dewey B. Larson's books about 
          his comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe, especially his book ""THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION"", it is 
          clear to me that ""black holes"" are NOTHING more than 
          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIES!  The strange object at Cygnus X-1 is 
          just an unusually massive WHITE DWARF STAR, NOT the ""black 
          hole"" that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want 
          to ""prove"" their theory. 
    
    
               By the way, I do NOT understand why so much publicity is

          astronomers seem to be acting as if Hawking's severe physical 
          problem somehow makes him ""wiser"".  It does NOT! 
    
               I wish the same attention had been given to Physicist 
          Dewey B. Larson while he was still alive.  Widespread 
          publicity and attention should NOW be given to Larson's 
          Theory, books, and organization (The International Society of 
          Unified Science). 
          
          
          
          ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION

               I heard of that concept many years ago, in connection 
          with UFO's and unorthodox inventors, but I never was able to 
          find out how or why they work, or how they are constructed. 
    
               I found a possible clue about why they might work on 
          pages 112-113 of the book ""BASIC PROPERTIES OF MATTER"", by 
          the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson, which describes part of 
          Larson's comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe.  I quote one paragraph: 
    
               ""As indicated in the preceding chapter, the development 
          of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally 
          different concept of the nature of electrical resistance.  
          The electrons, we find, are derived from the environment.  It 
          was brought out in Volume I [Larson's book ""NOTHING BUT 
          MOTION""] that there are physical processes in operation which 
          produce electrons in substantial quantities, and that, 
          although the motions that constitute these electrons are, in 
          many cases, absorbed by atomic structures, the opportunities 
          for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are 
          limited.  It follows that there is always a large excess of 
          free electrons in the material sector [material half] of the 
          universe, most of which are uncharged.  In this uncharged 
          state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension 
          space, because they are inherently rotating units of space, 
          and the relation of space to space is not motion.  In open 
          space, therefore, each uncharged electron remains permanently 
          in the same location with respect to the natural reference 
          system, in the manner of a photon.  In the context of the 
          stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron, 
          like the photon, is carried outward at the speed of light by 
          the progression of the natural reference system.  All 
          material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons 
          similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation.  
          Meanwhile there are other processes, to be discussed later, 
          whereby electrons are returned to the environment.  The 
          electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth 
          therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level."" 
          
               Note that in Larson's Theory, UNcharged electrons are 
          also massLESS, and are basically photons of light of a 
          particular frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) spinning 
          around one axis at a particular rate (below the ""unit"" rate).  
          (""Unit velocity"" is the speed of light, and there are 
          vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light, 
          according to Larson's Theory.)  [I might have the ""above"" and 
          ""below"" labels mixed up.] 
    
               Larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass-
          LESS UN-charged electrons flying around at the speed of 
          light! 
    
               If this is true, then the ELECTRO-MAGNETIC PROPULSION 
          fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these 
          electrons, or other particles in space, perhaps GIVING them a 
          charge (and mass) and shooting them toward the rear to 
          achieve propulsion. (In Larson's Theory, an electrical charge 
          is a one-dimensional rotational vibration of a particular 
          frequency (above the ""unit"" frequency) superimposed on the 
          rotation of the particle.) 
      
               The paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to 
          confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is 
          generated in clouds. 



          SUPPRESSION of LARSONIAN Physics

               The comprehensive GENERAL UNIFIED Theory of the physical 
          universe developed by the late Physicist Dewey B. Larson has 
          been available for more than 30 YEARS, published in 1959 in 
          his first book ""THE STRUCTURE OF THE PHYSICAL UNIVERSE"". 
    
               It is TOTALLY UN-SCIENTIFIC for Hawking, Wheeler, Sagan, 
          and the other SACRED PRIESTS of the RELIGION they call 
          ""science"" (or ""physics"", or ""astronomy"", etc.), as well as 
          the ""scientific"" literature and the ""education"" systems, to 
          TOTALLY IGNORE Larson's Theory has they have. 
    
               Larson's Theory has excellent explanations for many 
          things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers, such 
          as gamma-ray bursts and the nature of quasars. 
    
               Larson's Theory deserves to be HONESTLY and OPENLY 
          discussed in the physics, chemistry, and astronomy journals, 
          in the U.S. and elsewhere.  And at least the basic principles 
          of Larson's Theory should be included in all related courses 
          at UW-EC, UW-Madison, Cambridge, Cornell University, and 
          elsewhere, so that students are not kept in the dark about a 
          worthy alternative to the DOGMA they are being fed. 
    
          

               For more information, answers to your questions, etc., 
          please consult my CITED SOURCES (especially Larson's BOOKS).

"
Also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode
(probably a spin-stabilized sun-pointing orientation) is a dollar not
spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft.  In order to turn the
spacecraft back on, you either need to insure that the Ops guys will be
available, or you need to retrain a new team.

Having said that, there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed.
Many of the operational satellites Goddard flies (like the Tiros NOAA 
series) require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set.
Extras which get replaced on-orbit are powered into a ""standby"" mode for
use in an emergency.  In that case, however, the same ops team is still
required to fly the operational birds; so the standby maintenance is
relatively cheap.

Finally, Pat's explanation (some spacecraft require continuous maintenance
to stay under control) is also right on the mark.  I suggested a spin-
stabilized control mode because it would require little power or 
maintenance, but it still might require some momentum dumping from time
to time.

In the end, it *is* a political decision (since the difference is money),
but there is some technical rationale behind the decision.",space

And another survivor claims he heard someone shouting ""The fire's started!"".
Odd terminology.  That's what one says when you know a fire is planned, not 
when one occurs by accident.  We will have to wait and see what the evidence 
shows, assuming one is willing to believe any evidence offered by the 
""distrustful ones"".


Neither.  Again I was merely addressing the sanity level of the players.  
I agree that the BATF handled the affair badly from day one.  BTW, I heard 
on the news today that the affadavit behind the no-knock warrant was unsealed 
today.  Grenade launcher was the only thing on the list that I found 
unusual.


Ambitious news reporters could use the documentary filmed by an Australian 
in 1992 on the compound grounds to help identify survivors.  I, for one, 
will check their stories for consistency with what I learned in a long 
news story about that documentary.


Certainly there is some room for doubt.  I certainly reserve the right 
to change my opinions when new evidence warrants such a change.  If I 
were conspiratorially minded, however, I would never be able to change 
my mind, because any evidence I disliked would have to be a lie 
fabricated by the ""distrustful ones"".

The documentary interviewed Koresh and current and ex-members.  
The documentary disucussed Koresh's ""Christ"" status inside the cult, 
cult brain-washing techniques, and unusual sex practices (the leader

others decide if using religious authority to have sex with a minor is 
technically child abuse or not.


All true.


Well, if a fire was deliberately set by members of the cult, then the 
history and background of the cult is very relevant.  The history 
and backgournd of the Jones cult was very important in understanding 
what happened at Jonestown.

Not taking into account the history and background of Koresh's cult may 
also help explain why the FBI and BATF so badly predicted the reponses 
they would get from inside the compund nearly every step of the way in 
this badly handled affair.


It is likely that there will be at least two investigations (JD and congress)

the Indians or Tigers.  Basically, the Red Sox are stronger this year
at 1B, DH, SS, LF, and RF.  They have healthier starting pitchers (so
far, at least) and better relievers.  I see no reason why they
shouldn't win ~85 games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles and
the Tigers *still* have no pitching.  They will win some 20-3
blowouts, but they will lose an awful lot of 7-5 games too.

"Recently while looking around in Traders Sporting Goods store, a very well
stocked firearms store, I discovered a printed document that was being 
distributed by the good folks who work there.  Traders, BTW, is located in
San Leandro, CA.

Granted, the document may be asking you and I to help out Traders, but in the
big scope of things, I feel that we would do all gun owners a favor by helping
to this cause.

Anyway, here it is:

NEWSPAPER AD CENSORSHIP

Are you letting the newspapers tell you how to live your life, what's good for
you, what's not, and exercise blatant censorship over what you read in their
advertisments?

The newspapers have now decided to censor gun ads - which is why you no longer
see the ads that Traders, San Leandro, has run for many years.

These ads were run for the law-abiding honest citizens who own firearms for
sporting use or self-protection.  They certainly have the right to do so, under
the Second Amendment Right to Bear Arms.

If you are tired of newspapers who run sex and liquor ads galor, yet refuse to
run legitimate gun ads, please send a letter to the editors indicating your
displeasure over their censorship doctrine.

Following is a list of Bay area newspapers who censor gun ads.  Perhaps you'd
like to send them your thoughts on this issue!

Then there are six pages of ""facts"".  I can not validate these facts, and 
there were no sources, but many feel and sound very true.  Here are the topic
headlines:

- Big Media Snow Job
- Blaming Firearms for Murder is Like Blaming Hospitals for Death
- I could use the same Nazi Journalistic Technique of CBS and ABC to prove
  that Hospitals Cause Death
- How NBC, CBS, and ABC have scammed the American people on ""gun control""
- American TV journalism is based on Nazi journalism
- Why TV journalists lie
- The Government with the help of the TV networks, has succeeded in playing
  one group against the other
- Gun laws are unconstitutional
- American gun laws are based on Nazi gun laws
- The Government is trying to devide and conquer
- The CIA wants your firearms

and so on for six pages.

So now we have the media trying help put gun dealers out of business by trying
to limit their exposure to potential customers, and preventing the customers
from reading about sales of ammunition and firearms for sporting, hunting, or
other recreational use.

Let me know if you write to any of these bozos.

======================================================================

DETAILED DESCRIPTION:
=====================

    Artists, designers, scientists, engineers and educators share the
    problem of moving information from one mind to another.
    Traditionally, they have used pictures, words, demonstrations,
    music and dance to communicate imagery.  However, expressing
    complex notions such as God and infinity or a seemingly well
    defined concept such as a flower can present challenges which far
    exceed their technical skills.

    The explosive use of computers as visualization and expression
    tools has compounded this problem.  In hypermedia, multimedia and
    virtual reality systems vast amounts of information confront the
    observer or participant.  Wading through a multitude of
    simultaneous images and sounds in possibly unfamiliar
    representions, a confounded user asks: ""What does it all mean?""

    Since image construction, transmission, reception, decipherment and
    ultimate understanding are complex tasks, strongly influenced by
    physiology, education and culture; and, since electronic media
    radically amplify each processing step, then we, as electronic
    communicators, must determine the fundamental paradigms for
    composing imagery for understanding.

    Therefore, the purpose of this conference is to bring together a
    breadth of disciplines, including, but not limited to, the
    physical, biological and computational sciences, technology, art,
    psychology, philosophy, and education, in order to define and
    discuss the issues essential to image understanding within the
    computer graphics context.

"Kevin Mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated 
pitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over 
New York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started 
with a solid single to right, moved to second on ""Bob"" Kelly's infield sneaker
down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a 
rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.

Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only 
given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double
by Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after
Joe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who 
argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by ""drawing the line"" (really, he
should know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting
tossed.

The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must 
have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's
single, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell
and turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson
failed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:

Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield
to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:
Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.
(Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)

The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's
ground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back
singles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long
fly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but
third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was
hung out to dry killing the Reds rally.

Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner
on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game
in late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on
Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended
up walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a 
week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went
to Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings
work, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit
surprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.

The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory
today.  The Mets are 6-5.

"Here is a press release from the White House.

 President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A
 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, April 20 /U.S. Newswire/ -- Following are
remarks by President Clinton in a question and answer session
with the press (Part 2 of 2):

     Go ahead, Sarah.

     Q  There are two questions I want to ask you.  The
first is, I think that they knew very well that the children did not
have gas masks while the adults did, so the children had no chance
because this gas was very -- she said it was not lethal, but it was
very dangerous to the children and they could not have survived
without gas masks.  And on February 28th -- let's go back -- didn't
those people have a right to practice their religion?

     THE PRESIDENT:  They were not just practicing their
religion, they were -- the Treasury Department believed that they had
violated federal laws, any number of them.

     Q  What federal laws --

     THE PRESIDENT:  Let me go back and answer -- I can't
answer the question about the gas masks, except to tell you that the
whole purpose of using the tear gas was that it had been tested; they
were convinced that it wouldn't kill either a child or an adult but
it would force anybody that breathed it to run outside.  And one of
the things that I've heard -- I don't want to get into the details of
this because I don't know -- but one of the things that they were
speculating about today was that the wind was blowing so fast that
the windows might have been opened and some of the gas might have
escaped and that may be why it didn't have the desired effect.

     They also knew, Sarah, that there was an underground
compound -- a bus buried underground where the children could be
sent.  And they were -- I think they were hoping very much that if
the children were not released immediately outside that the humane
thing would be done and that the children would be sent someplace
where they could be protected.

     In terms of the gas masks themselves, I learned
yesterday -- I did not ask this fact question before -- that the gas
was supposed to stay active in the compound longer than the gas masks
themselves were to work.  So that it was thought that even if they
all had gas masks, that eventually the gas would force them out in a
nonviolent, nonshooting circumstance.

     MS. MYERS:  Last question.

     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying that --

     Q  Could you tell us whether or not you ever asked
Janet Reno about the possibility of a mass suicide?  And when you
learned about the actual fire and explosion what went through your
mind during those horrendous moments?

     THE PRESIDENT:  What I asked Janet Reno is if they had
considered all the worse things that could happen.  And she said --
and, of course, the whole issue of suicide had been raised in the
public -- he had -- that had been debated anyway.  And she said that
the people who were most knowledgeable  about these kinds of issues
concluded that there was no greater risk of that now than there would
be tomorrow or the next day or the day after that or at anytime in
the future.  That was the judgment they made.  Whether they were
right or wrong, of course, we will never know.

     What happened when I saw the fire, when I saw the
building burning?  I was sick.  I felt terrible.  And my immediate
concern was whether the children had gotten out and whether they were
escaping or whether they were inside, trying to burn themselves up.
That's the first thing I wanted to know.

     Thank you.

     Q  Mr. President, why are you still saying it was a
Janet Reno decision?  Isn't it, in the end, your decision?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, what I'm saying is that I didn't
have a four- or five-hour, detailed briefing from the FBI.  I didn't
go over every strategic part of it.  It is a decision for which I
take responsibility.  I'm the President of the United States and I
signed off on the general decision and giving her the authority to
make the last call.  When I talked to her on Sunday, some time had
elapsed.  She might have made a decision to change her mind.  I said,
if you decide to go forward with this tomorrow, I will support you.
And I do support her.

     She is not ultimately responsible to the American
people; I am.  But I think she has conducted her duties in an
appropriate fashion and she has dealt with this situation I think as
well as she could have.

     Thank you.  (Applause.)",politics

By ""they,"" you mean the leaders of the lds church?  I grant you that when
Joseph Smith was still alive, plenty of ""accusations"" were filed, most of
which had little bearing with reality, as evidenced by various verdicts.
I have studied lds history for 15 years now, and I have yet to see prove
that the lds leadership was involved, in quote: ""illegal activities.""
Plural marriage, yes, but your charge of ""underage"" wives sounds like it
could have originated from a tabloid, and discredits the high moral
standards which characterized these leaders and families, unlike, as it
appears, those of David Koresh.

#        Joseph Smith started the sect.  After he and his brother Hyram
#were murdered in a Nauvoo, Il. jail cell, church membership split over
#who to follow.  Initially, Smith was considered a prophet (just like
#Mohammed, a rather interesting parallel considering Muslims consider
#Christ to be a prophet the same as Jews, I'm led to understand.  Make
#no mistake, this was no messiah we're talking about in Smith).  The

And neither did he claim he was.  As the church reflects the moral
aptitude of its leaders (and especially those of Joseph Smith), I have
nothing but the highest respect for this inspired man, whose only ""crime""
was that he refused to deny that he had seen a vision...  Many have tried
to explain the ""Smith phenomenon"" away, but the bold presence of an 8.5
million member strong church stands as a witness that Joseph Smith's
testimony had enough resilience and power to carry on the message.

#thought at the time was that the gift of prophecy was to be handed
#down father to son.  After Joseph Smith died, his son was only
#entering his teens.  Brigham Young and a few others claimed to have
#been bequeathed the gift and leadership prior to his death.  The
#Council of Twelve, the Church governing body, wasn't of much help
#here, and this basic conflict is still a wedge between the sects.
#Brigham Young took his followers to Salt Lake.  The rest waited
#for Smith Jr. to grow up enough to assume leadership.  The other
#claimants to the leadership were soon ignored, like Mike Dukakis. ;-)

""The rest"" were apostates and excommunicated members of the Church,
while the great majority of the membership, the Twelve, and the various
auxiliary organizations, chose to accept Brigham Young as the new
prophet and leader of the Church.  If you knew your lds scriptures and
doctrine, you would have known that Brigham Young was the FIRST in
line to fill the prophet Joseph Smith's vacancy: he was the senior
apostle in the Quorum, and various comments made by Joseph indicated
that it was Brigham who would lead the latter-day exodus to the West.

Other rightful ""heirs"" were either dead (Hyrum Smith) or excommunicated
(Oliver Cowdery), and while persecutions abounded and intensified,
Joseph Smith had already given orders to look for a new place, an empty
land beyond the boundaries of the United States (at that time).  This
""Rekhabite"" principle (pseudographia) was well understood and antipated
by the great majority of lds faithful, and was not questioned by them.

Granted, a couple of ""do-it-yourselfers"" stayed behind, unwilling to
sacrifice and to undertake the perilous journey to the unknown, but
this also was necessary to separate the tares from the wheat.  The
church benefitted from this purification process: they became even
more unified and willing to carry out their mission to the world.

#        Both sects practiced the ""1-year food stockpile"" doctrine,
#and this being frontier and farming country most carried or at
#least owned weapons.  There is little evidence that they were a
#militaristic sect, given that they tended to move on rather than
#face large-scale opposition.  Brigham Young, having suffered a
#great deal getting to Salt Lake, seems to have been quite
#justified in making military training a good thing.  Remember,
#this was far beyond where even the US Army went, and these people
#had nobody to turn to save themselves.
#
#        Just a little context to put this all in perspective.

BTW, since when is the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (one of
the largest denominations in the country) a ""sect""???  It didn't ""splinter""
from any other religion, as did say, the Southern Baptists or Methodists.

#>impressed with the way they kept secrets.  (They're pledged to defend
#>secrets with their lives and atone for sin with blood.  Many actually

What a balloney.  Suicide is sinful and against the law of God.  I am
not comfortable with this alleged ""cosiness"" with Mammon: I assure you
that *many* among us reject this attitude categorically.  Period.  Our
ONLY true allegiance is to our God and to the leaders which He has
appointed to represent Him.  In any regard, to read this TRASH (about
suicide and ""atone for sins with blood"") is yet another insulting
misrepresentation of what my church believes in and stands for...

#
#        The RLDS, the Reorganized LDS, are friendly rivals of the LDS
#and delight in telling stories about them, which generates quick retorts
#from the LDS members and everybody has a grand time.  At no time have
#I ever even heard this hinted at.  I'm taking it with a salt block.

Preposterous.  Even if this were true (reliable data, please), I
am convinced that those officers would perform to the highest codes
of honor and conduct (that's why they were selected for in the
first place, remember?).  Besides, one of our Articles of Faith
STRONGLY states the principle of freedom of religion, and that all
people are free to worship ""*how*, *where*, or *what* they may.""

#        If it's true, there would be little affect.  LDS and RLDS
#philosophy is that all other religions have strayed from the true
#Church as set down by Jesus, but that God will judge each on his
#own merits.  In addition, the RLDS also contend (and the LDS may
#as well) that ignorance of the True Way (tm) is an excuse.  You
#can only be condemned if you had been tought the way and rejected
#it.  In short, LDS and RLDS suffer everybody from Lutherans to
#Buddhists, secure in the knowledge that though they are wrong they
#will not be penalized for ignorance.  It is more likely that Hoover
#liked them because of their rather strict upbringings which forbade
#alcohol, tobacco, hot drink (like coffee or tea), and the like.
#These people are the ""salt of the Earth"" and as such are more
#easily made to follow orders and have few vices to be used against them.

A good explanation, I can accept that.  You are right that lds people
are sometimes a little too cosy with Mammon's ""orders"" (the late
president Kimball, for example, was an exception with his strong
opposition of the selection of the MX ""Peace Keeper"" missile maze
in Utah).

#        That's my somewhat educated guess, anyway.  Both sects have
#splinter groups that don't mirror the masses, but these are small
#and rare, and hardly worth noting their common ancestry.
#
#        None of this has any relevance to guns, though.  When a
#man's religion is used to deny him the right of self-protection with
#the weapons suitable for the job, he'll find an ally in me.

Even though I find this to be funny on the surface, the original poster of the
joke has  tried and convicted the members of the BD to be a bunch of ""nuts"".
This may be a dangerous thing to do.  It is my opinion that most educated
or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government.
This should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time
will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was 
created for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line.
That and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press
portrays a group of people as ""nuts"" or crazies, a violation of those
people's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the 
gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the
2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk 
voted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with
domocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.
  Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the 
official press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to
public safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information.
So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very
agency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their
advantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they
were portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification
what so ever of doing what they did.
   So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny,
may mislead the public from the truth of the matter.

Just as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton
leads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's
(in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be
unconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least).
And since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved
in this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to 
find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA.
It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly
unconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement).

This was (my opinion) the stupidest thing in the Hidden Game. The
argument was

1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game.
2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.

3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and
earned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12%
of defense and pitching is 88% of defense.
4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.

Pete is usually sharper than that. My own feel is that fielding is in
the 25-33% of defense range; call it 30-70 between fielding and
pitching.


I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe 45-5, or
even 40-10. Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds
identical batting stats (which wouldn't be that unreasonable), and
even if you don't let Roberto steal a single base, they'll score a lot
more than the Oleruds by going first-to-third more often. (No offense,

I haven't seen any speculation about it. But, the Salyut KB (Design Bureau) 
was planning a new LH/LOX second stage for the Proton which would boost
payload to LEO from about 21000 to 31500 kg. (Geostationary goes from
2600 kg. (Gals launcher version) to 6000 kg.. This scheme was competing
with the Energia-M last year and I haven't heard which won, except now
I recently read that the Central Specialized KB was working on the 
successor to the Soyuz booster which must be the Energia-M. So the early
results are Energia-M won, but this is a guess, nothing is very clear in 
Russia. I'm sure if Salyut KB gets funds from someone they will continue 
their development. 

The Centaur for the Altas is about 3 meters dia. and the Proton 
is 4 so that's a good fit for their existing upper stage, the Block-D
which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia. I don't know about
launch loads, etc.. but since the Centaur survives Titan launches which
are probably worse than the Proton (those Titan SRB's probably shake things
up pretty good) it seems feasible. EXCEPT, the Centaur is a very fragile
thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now.
Protons are assembled and transported horizontially. Does anyone know 
how much stress in the way of a payload a Centaur could support while
bolted to a Proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track
and erected on the pad?  

They would also need LOX and LH facilities added to the Proton pads 
(unless the new Proton second stage is actually built), and of course
any Centaur support systems and facilities, no doubt imported from the
US at great cost. These systems may viloate US law so there are political
problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the CIS you mention. ",space

Wishful thinking mostly. It's more likely that the Moon will never
be the site of major commercial activity. As far as we know it has no
materials we can't get cheaper right here on Earth or from asteroids
and comets, aside from the semi-mythic He3 that *might* be useful in low
grade fusion reactors. Exploring it would satisfy a curiosity itch, 
and it's position in the gravity well of Earth coupled with it's heat 
sink capacity could offer some military utility for ""high ground"" military
weapons systems, but it holds very minute commercial value. If space 
travel becomes cheap enough, it might become a tourist attraction as 
Mt. Everest and the Antarctic have become, but that's a very minor 
activity in the global scope of things.

Luna has an inconvienent gravity field. It's likely too low to prevent
calcium loss, muscle atrophy, and long term genetic drift. Yet it's
too high to do micro-G manufacturing. Space based colonies and factories
that can be spun to any convienent value of G look much better. Luna
has a modest vacuum and raw solar exposure two weeks a month, but orbital
sites can have better vacuums and continous solar exposure. Luna offers
a source of light element rocks that can serve as raw materials, heatsink,
and shielding. The asteroids and comets offer sources of both light and
heavy elements, and volatile compounds, and many are in less steep gravity
wells so that less delta-v is required to reach them.

We don't use 2/3rds of the Earth now, the seafloors, and we virtually
ignore Antarctica, a whole continent. That's because we don't have to
deal with those conditions in order to make a buck. Luna is a much more
expensive place to visit, or to live and work. I think we'll use the
easier places first. That pushes Lunar development back at least a few
centuries, if not much longer.

Luna's main short term value would be as a place for a farside radio
astronomy observatory, shielded from the noisy Earth. Or as the site
of a laser, particle beam, or linear accelerator weapons system for
defending Earth, or bombarding it as the case may be. The first is
unlikely because of the high cost for such a basic science instrument.
The second is just as unlikely because conventional nukes are good
enough, and the military would really rather see the Earth safe for
conventional warfare again. There's little glory in watching from a
bunker as machines fight each other over continental ranges. Little
ultimate profit either.

"----------------------------------------------------------------------
Open letter by Dr. Paul H. Blackman, Research Coordinator for
NRA-ILA. NRA Official Journal 1/89.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Dear sir:

By now, we are used to the New England Journal of Medicine's publication
of small-scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are
drawn which are quantum leaps from the data, followed by announcements of 
momentus ""scientific"" findings. These are regularly released to the press
without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs, and
often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings.
Generally, while they at least present a few interesting data, however
meaningless, the studies misinterpret statistics, and ignore or belittle
serious studies by criminologists.

The latest effort -- ""Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults, and Homicide:
A Tale of Two Cities,"" by J.H. Sloan, et al., with the accompanying 
editorial, ""Firearms Injuries: A Call for Science,"" by two employees
of the Centers for Disease Control (November 10), however, is an insult
to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few
data and so many flaws that I feel compelled to write at some length
to call attention to various major and minor failings, in no particular
order.

	1. The authors misleadingly cite Wright, et al. (Ref. 1) to 
	support the statement that ""some have argued that restricting
	access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate
	of homicide."" Wright, et al., in fact studied and rejected that
	contention.
	
	2. The authors pretended that Vancouver and Seattle are very
	similar cities with similar economic circumstances, histories,
	demographic characteristics, and the like. In fact, the cities
	are very different with very different demographic characteristics
	which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in
	Seattle. Both cities are over three-forths non-Hispanic white
	and *the non-Hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be
	the same in Seattle and Vancouver*. It is the different back-
	grounds, problems, circumstances, and behaviors of the various
	ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide.
	
	3. The authors pretend they are evaluating Canada's gun law,
	compared to Washington State's. But they do not examine at all
	the situation in Vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect
	in 1978. As it happens, in the three years prior to that (1975-
	1977), Vancouver averaged 23 homicides per year, one-eighth
	involving handguns, (Ref. 2) and in the seven years of the NEJM
	article there were 29 homicides per year, one-eigth involving
	handguns. Surely even the medical profession recognizes that
	one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding
	that a change made a difference? Would a physician conclude that
	a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day
	for seven years because his cholesterol level was 200 without
	at least seeing if it was 180 before he started the regimen?
	
	4. The authors pick two medium-sized cities to evaluate a national
	gun law. Nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily
	selected sample. Seattle appears to have been selected because
	it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific
	reason. Would physicians call something a scientific study which
	involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar ""control""?
	Had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen, opposite
	""scientific"" conclusions would follow: Vancouver's homicide
	rate *exceeds* that of such ""wild west"" cities in Texas as
	El Paso, Corpus Christi, Austen, and, in Colorado, Colorado
	Springs. (Ref. 3)
	
	5. The authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or
	handguns ""are far more commonly owned in Seattle than in
	Vancouver."" They use two surrogate approaches in pretending
	to study the availability of firearms/handguns. The first is
	an apples-and-oranges effort to compare the number of carry
	permits in Seattle to the number of registered handguns in
	Vancouver. But the number clearly understates the number of
	handguns in Seattle, and counts primarily *protective* handgun
	owners. The second, however, tells nothing about the number
	of handguns in Vancouver, and counts *non-protective* handguns
	for the most part. Where is it difficult to obtain handguns
	legally for protection, registration figures are
	meaningless. There are 66,000 registered handguns in New York
	City (New York Daily News, Sept. 27, 1987). Comparing the two,
	that method suggests about 930 handguns per 100,000 population
	in New York City compared to 960 in Vancouver, meaning Vancouver
	has a greater ""prevalence of weapons"" than New York City.
	
	The second method of measuring gun density is ""Cook's gun
	prevalence index, a previously validated measure of intercity
	differences."" But the validation was by Cook of his own
	theory. (Ref. 4) Normally, second opinions are sought from a
	different doctor. More significantly, the Cook index is
	based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement
	in suicide and homicide. So the authors are basically taking
	a measure of misuse. Unsurprisingly, gun misuse in homicide
	(42% in Seattle, 14% in Vancouver) is related to gun misuse in
	homicide plus suicide, divided by two (41% in Seattle, 12% in
	Vancouver). The authors are not measuring the relative avail-
	ability of firearms, or of handguns, in Seattle and
	Vancouver.
	
	6. The authors misstate the laws of both Washington and
	Canada. They neglect to mention the significant fact that
	Washington has a waiting period and background check prior to
	the purchase of a handgun, and that provisions exist in Canadian
	law for owning and carrying handguns for personal
	protection. The authors also make it appear that it is more
	difficult to get a handgun legally in Canada than is actually
	the case.
	
	7. The authors ignore all other factors which might explain
	the differences in crime rate, beyond some vague mention of the
	penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of 
	clearence for one particular offense -- homicide involving a
	firearm. There is no measure of: the differences in the number
	of law enforcement officers; their aggressiveness in making
	arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions; arrest
	rates for other offenses; conviction rates; actual sentences
	imposed for gun-related crimes, violent crimes without guns,
	or gun law violations; or incarceration rates. Whereas social
	scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences,
	the authors of the NEJM ""tale of two cities"" fail even to mention
	most factors related to crime control.
	
	8. The authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective
	means for protection unless the criminal is killed. Such is not
	the case. Criminologists (Ref. 5-8) have found that almost
	650,000 Americans annually use handguns for protection from
	criminals, and that using a gun for protection reduces the
	liklihood that a crime -- rape, robbery, assault -- will be
	completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury
	to the victim. It is interesting, nonetheless, that the authors
	reported the same number (four) of civilian justifiable homicides
	without firearms in each city but that less restrictive Seattle
	accounted for 100% of the reported civilian justifiable homicides
	involving firearms.
	
	9. The Centers for Disease Control, which funded the ""study,""
	editorially praised the paper, (Ref. 9) saying it ""applied
	scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb
	advocates of stricter regulation of firearms, particularly
	handguns."" There is nothing in the paper which could possibly
	be mistaken for ""scientific methods"" by a sociologists or
	criminologists. The Vancouver-Seattle ""study"" is the equivolent
	of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding
	two ordinary-looking middle-class white males, one aged 25
	and the other 40, and without first taking their vital signs,
	administering the experimental drug to the 25-year-old while
	giving the 40-year-old a placebo, then taking their blood pressure
	and, on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure, 
	announcing in a ""special article"" a new medical breakthrough.
	It would be nice to think that such a ""study"" would neither be
	funded by the CDC or printed by the NEJM.
	
	Since the longstanding anti-gun biases of the NEJM and the CDC
	make them willing to present shoddy research as ""scientific
	breakthroughs"" in ""special articles"" and editorials relating
	to firearms, we are obligated to correct the record by notifying
	the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight
	over the activities of the Centers for Disease Control about
	the distortions contained in ""Handgun Regulations, Crime, Assaults,
	and Homicides: A Tale of Two Cities"" and ""Firearm Injuries: A Call
	for Science."" Clearly, all scientific standards go by the wayside
	whenever the CDC and the New England Journal of Medicine seize
	an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in America.

                             GUNS AND SPUTTER
                            by James D. Wright
          (from July 1989 issue of REASON, Free Minds & Free Markets)

   suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.""  The problem is demonstrated
   by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting
   to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide.  Funded by
   the federal government and published last year in the New England Journal
   of Medicine, the study compared homicide rates in Seattle and Vancouver and
   suggested that a handgun ban ""may reduce the rate of homicide in a 
   community.""
      The nine medical doctors who published ""Handgun Regulations, Crime,
   Assaults, and Homicide"" essentially reasoned in three steps: (1) Despite
   many historical, social, and demographic similarities, (2) Vancouver
   has a markedly lower homicide rate (3) because its stricter gun regulations
   make guns less available.  The second step in their reasoning seems
   indisputable.  The overall homicide rate in Seattle (for the period
   1980-86) was 11.3 per 100,000 popuation, compared with 6.9 in Vancouver.
   Homicide is definitely more common in Seattle.  The question then becomes,
   Why?
      The authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case
   to support the notion, as claimed in the third step of their reasoning,
   that Vancouver's handgun regulations are much more stringent.  But their
   evidence on the difference in gun *availabilty* is indirect and 
   unpersuasive; indeed, they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point
   does not exist.  They offer two fragments of inferential data in support
   of the claim that guns are more available in Seattle; but for all anybody
   knows as a matter of empirical fact, the opposite could be true.  We
   are therefore being asked, at the conclusion of the study, to believe that
   a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates
   when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established.
      Indeed, the situation is even more troublesome.  The first of the two
   indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed-
   weapons permits issued in Seattle and the number of restricted-weapons
   permits issued in Vancouver.  Differences between the two cities in the
   permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable.
*     The second bit of evidence is ""Cook's gun prevalence index,"" which stands
*  at 41 percent for Seattle but only 12 percent for Vancouver.  Cook's index
*  however, does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in 
*  various cities.  It measures gun misuse--it is an average of the percentage
*  of homicides and suicides involving firearms.
*     In the present case, the index shows only that in homicides and suicides,
*  firearms are more likely to be used in Seatte than in Vancouver.  To take
*  Cook's index as a measure of general firearms availability, it must be
*  assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides
*  is directly related to their relative availability in the general 
*  population.  But this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove. To
*  assume what one is seeking to prove, then to ""prove"" it on the basis of
*  that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything.
      Even if we were to grant, on the basis of no compelling evidence, that
   guns are less common in Vancouver, we might still question what causes what.
   The authors attribute Seattle's higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun
   ownership.  But it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates
   reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns--in other words,
   that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership, not vice versa.
      In fact, it was once commonly argued that Great Britain's low rate of
   violent crime was a function of that nation's strict gun laws and the 
   consequent low rate of gun ownership--until British researcher Colin 
   Greenwood found that Great Britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime
   for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted.  To invoke
   an ancient methodological saw, correlation is not cause.
      Nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data
   on gun ownership.  The authors say Seattle and Vancouver are ""similar in
   many ways,"" implying that they differ mainly in gun availability, gun-law
   stringency, and crime rates.  This is an evident attempt to establish
   the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis--that ""all
   else is equal"" among things being compared.
*     Clearly the two cities are similar in some ways, but a closer look 
*  reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime
*  or homicide rates.  The cities are closely matched in what percentage
*  of their population is white (79 percent and 76 percent).  But Seattle
*  is about 10 percent black, while Vancouver is less than 0.5 percent.
*  Vancouver's minority population is overwhelmingly Asian.  So although the
*  authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half-
*  dozen readily available demographic indicators, they have not shown
*  that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out.
*     In fact, the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is
*  particularly relevant in light of the study's breakdown of homicide rates
*  according to the race of the victim.  For the white majority, the homicide
*  rates are nearly identical--6.2 per 100,000 in Seattle, 6.4 in Vancouver.
*  The differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due
*  entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities.  For blacks,
*  the observed difference in homicide rate is 36.6 to 9.5 and for Hispanics
*  26.9 to 7.9.  (Methodoligical complexities render the Asian comparison
*  problematic, but it too is higher in Seattle than in Vancouver.)  Racial
*  minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in Seattle
*  than in Vancouver; the white majority is equally likely to be slain
*  in either city.
      Since the nearly 2:1 initial difference in homicide reates between the
   cities is due exclusively to 3:1 or 4:1 differences between minority 
   groups, it is fair to ask why postulated difference in ""gun availability""
   (or gun-law strigency) would matter so dramatically to minorities but not
   matter at all to whites.  Can differential gun availability explain why
   blacks and Hispanics--but not whites--are so much more likely to be killed
   in Seattle than in Vancouver?  (Studies in the United States, incidentally,
   do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership.)
      Or are other explanations more plausible?  Could the disparity between
   Canadian and American rates of poverty among racial minorities have 
   anything to do with it?  What are the relative rates of drug or alcohol 
   abuse?  Of homelessness among each cty's minority population?  (The city
   of Seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the 
   Mississippi.)  Unemployment among young, central-city, nonwhite men in the
   United States usually exceeds 40 percent.  What is the comparable Canadian
   percentage?
      The crucial point is that Canada and the United States differ in many
   ways, as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries.  Absent
   more detailed analysis, nearly any of these ""many ways"" might explain part
   or all of the difference in homicide rates.  In gross comparisons such
   as those between Seattle and Vancouver, all else is *not* equal.
*     The authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide
*  result in a ""complex picture.""  They do not acknowledge that the ensuing
*  complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument.  They
*  also acknowledge that ""socio-economic status is probably an important
*  confounding factor in our comparison,"" remarking further that ""blacks   
*  in Vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in 1981 than the rest of
*  Vancouver's population.""  Given the evidence presented in the article,
*  it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between Seattle
*  and Vancouver results from greater proverty among Seattle's racial
*  minorities.  But the authors pay no further attention to this possibility,
*  since ""detailed information about household incomes according to race
*  is not available for Vancouver.""
      The largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in 
   gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple
   example.  If one were to take all U.S. couties and compare them in terms
   of (1) pervalence of gun ownership and (2) crime or homicide rates, one 
   would find an astonishing pattern: Counties with more guns have less crime.
   Would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce 
   crime?  Or would one insist that other variables also be taken into
   account?  In this example, the ""hidden variable"" is city size: Guns are
   more common in small towns and rural areas, whereas crime is a big-city
   problem.  If researchers failed to anticipate this variable, or lacked the
   appropriate data to examine its possible consequences, they coud be very
   seriously misled.  In the study at hand, the authors matched two cities
   for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables,
   and their results are impossible to interpret.
      In the editorial ""Firearm Injuries: A Call for Science"" accompanying
   the study, two officials from the Centers for Disease Control lauded the
   authors for applying ""scientific methods"" to a problem of grave public
   heath significance.  But in attempting to draw causal conclusions from
   nonexperimental research, the essence of scientific method is to anticipate
   plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them
   out.  Absent such effort, the results may well seem scientific but are
   little more than polemics masquerading as serious research.  That this
   study is but one of a number of recent efforts--all employing practical
   identical research designs and published in leading scientific journals--
   is cause for further concern.

"Here is a letter I sent to David Skaggs, (Dem, CO).  Before anybody says

reasonable and polite letters to him for years, and all I get in return

upsetting him will harm the cause.  Sorry if you disagree, but recent events
in Texas REALLY have me pissed.

-------------------
							April  20, 1993
Representative Skaggs,

Recently I wrote to you regarding my outrage over the tactics used by the
Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms, (BATF), in Texas.  In your response
you stated that ""Events in Texas underscore the need for stricter gun control
legislation to keep guns out of the hand of groups such as the Branch Davidians.
My question to you is, ""what grounds would you use to deny them access to 
firearms?""  Best I can tell this statement underscores your apparent total
ignorance of the subject, and highlights your personal bias against firearms.
I say this because there are only two possible paths of ""gun control"" which you
could have been referencing.

Either:
1) You were talking about their access to semi-automatics firearms.  In this
case I should point out that semi-automatic firearms are legal in most areas of
this Country, including Texas and Colorado.  In addition the members of the
""cult"" have never been convicted of any crimes which would deny them the ability
to purchase these weapons.  So under what grounds would you deny them these
guns?  Their religion?  The fact they they live in a large group alone by
themselves?  Because you consider them to be a cult?  Maybe I consider your
Church to be a cult!

This line of reasoning by you borders on the concept of ""thought crimes.""  You
and Pat Robertson should really get along.

2) You were referring to the ALLEGED FULLY automatic weapons possessed by the
""cult.""  Under current US law, FULLY automatic weapons have been covered by
some of the strictest gun control laws in this Nation.  So if David Koresh
illegally possessed them, he would have had to circumvent some of the strictest
laws we have.  How will more laws help?  By the way, it has been reported that
David Koresh possessed a Federal Firearms License which would have permitted 
him to possess FULLY automatic weapons.  If true, the 85 people who perished
Monday in the fire, died so that the Federal government could collect a couple
hundred dollars in taxes on guns David Koresh didn't declare.

I have heard claims that they were ""stockpiling weapons.""  Yet considering the
number of people in the complex, even 200+ weapons would not have been out of
line with gun ownership statistics for all of Texas.  What's next?  A siege of
Dallas/Ft Worth for alleged ""stockpiling?""

Face it David Skaggs, You have voted for virtually EVERY gun control law that
has passed through Congress, yet you claim that you are only for ""reasonable""
restrictions.  Bull****!   Handgun Control Inc. is struggling to maintain
250,000 PAID members, while the NRA has just exceeded 3,000,000 members.  They
are still growing at a rate of 2,000 new members per day.  Driving around YOUR
district I see NRA stickers every day.  In eight plus years of living here I
have only seen ONE HCI bumper sticker.  When you vote for your ""reasonable""
gun control laws, are you really representing your district, or are you
representing Sarah Bradys'?

DMorf (Dave's Morph, I think is what it means) and DTax (Dave's 
TGA Assembler) are available in the MSDOS_UPLOADS directory
on the wuarchive.

They are arjed and bundled with their respective xmemory versions,
dmorfx.exe and dtax.exe, you can also find a version of aaplay.exe
there, with which you can view files you create with dta.exe or
dtax.exe.

I downloaded the whole bunch last week and have been morphing 
away the afternoons since.  The programmes are all a bit buggy and
definitely not-ready-to-spread-to-the-masses, but they are very

The interface is frustrating at first, but it gets easy once you
figure out the tricks.

I have noticed that dmorfx will crash horribly if you try to morph
without using the splines option.  Not sure why, since I don't have
the source.  I think it was written for TP 6.0.

If anyone else comes up with any other hints on getting the thing 
to work right, tell me; it took me several hours the first time

I think its an attempt to show lives_saved v lives_lost; all other
 gun related crimes don't result in lives_lost.  On the other hand,
 its impossible to know how many of the successful self defenses 
 prevented lives from being lost.  In other words, the lives_lost
 is pretty clear [its the homicide and non negligent manslaughter
 number], while the lives saved is some percentage of the successful 
 self defenses.  Clearly that percentage doesn't have to be real 
 high to show that lives_saved > lives_lost.

As a semi-related point, check out Kleck's ""Point Blank"".  I believe
 it goes into some related areas; it also is well written and informative.

From the description of ad here, it sounds like they're talking about
""High Power Rocketry"", an outgrowth of model rocketry.  This hobby
uses non-metallic structural compoments and commerically manufactured
engines ranging in impulse classification from G to P.  The hobby
has been flourishing from early 1980s and is becoming increasing popular.
Technically this is not consider amateur rocketry.

Any rocket with a liftoff weight greater than 3.3 pounds OR using a
total impulse of G or greater, REQUIRES an FAA waiver to launch.
Typically, a group of people get an FAA waiver for specified period
of time (ie week, weekend, etc.) at a designated site and time, and
all of the launches are then covered under this ""blanket waiver"".
There is also a ""High Power Safety Code"" which designates more
specific rules such as launch field size, etc.

Finally, in order to purchase any of the larger (Class B) rocket 
motors you need to certified through either the National Association
of Rocketry or Tripoli Rocketry Association. Certification procedures
require a demonstarted handling and ""safe"" flight at a total impulse
level.

The sightings were apparently spurious.  There is no planet inside of
the orbit of Mercury.

The idea of Vulcan came from the differences between Mercury's observed
perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to
Newtonian physics.  Leverrier made an extensive set of observations
and calculations during the mid 19th century, and Simon Newcombe later
improved on the observations and re-calculated using Leverrier's system
of equations.  Now Leverrier was one of the co-discoverers of Neptune
and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit
of Uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was
afoot with Mercury.

But alas, 'twere not so.  Mercury's perihelion precesses at the rate
it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly
curved due to the sun's mass.  This explanation had to wait until 1915
and Albert Einstein's synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics
of moving bodies (commonly called Special Relativity) with Reimanian 
geometry.  The result was the General Theory of Relativity, and one of
it's most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession
of Mercury's perihelion almost exactly.  (Exactly if you use Newcomb's
numbers rather than Leverrier's.)

Of course not everybody believes Einstein, and that's fine.  But subsequent
efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than Mercury using radar
have been fruitless.

==========================================================================

2. Notes
========
(Excerpted from the FAQ article)

Please do *not* post or mail messages saying ""I can't FTP, could
someone mail this to me?""  There are a number of automated mail servers
that will send you things like this in response to a message.

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like ""send comp.sources.unix/fbm"",
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.

Renderers which are not raytracers, and graphics libraries:
-----------------------------------------------------------

SIPP - Scan line z-buffer and Phong shading renderer.
	Now uses the shadow buffer algorithm.
Tcl-SIPP - a Tcl command interface to the SIPP rendering
	program. Tcl-SIPP is a set of Tcl commands used to programmed
	SIPP without having to write and compile C code.
	Commands are used to specify surfaces, objects,
	scenes and rendering options.
	It renders either in PPM format or in Utah Raster Toolkit RLE format
	or to the photo widget in the Tk-based X11 applications.

VOGLE - graphics learning environment (device portable).
VOGL - an SGI GL-like library based on VOGLE.
REND386 - A *fast* polygon renderer for Intel 386s and up. Version 2 on up.
	[ It's not photorealistic, but rather a real-time renderer]

	and vort 3d objects. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric
	views in Postscript. Registered users get a TeX PK font converter and
	a superquadric surfaces generator.
	Glenn Lewis <glewis@pcocd2.intel.com>
	[Note : TTDDDLIB is also known as T3DLIB]

Online Bibliography Project :
        The ACM SIGGRAPH Online Bibliography Project is a database of 
        over 15,000 unique computer graphics and computational geometry
        references in BibTeX format, available to the computer graphics
        community as a research and educational resource.

        The database is located at ""siggraph.org"".  Users may download 
        the BibTeX files via FTP and peruse them offline, or telnet to
        ""siggraph.org"" and log in as ""biblio"" and interactively search
        the database for entries of interest, by keyword.
        For the people without Internet access, there's also an e-mail
        server. Send mail to

        archive-server@siggraph.org

        and in the subject or the body of the message include the message  send
        followed by the topic and subtopic you wish. A good place to start is
        with the command
             send index
        which will give you an up-to-date list of available information.

        Additions/corrections/suggestions may be directed to the admin,

4. Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes
===========================================

Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help.
Don't overuse mail servers.

There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these
mail servers have a command like
   path a_valid_return_e-mail_address
to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.

DEC's FTPMAIL
-------------
  Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,
  and having a line containing the word 'help'.
  You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you
  must follow in order to get the files you want.

  Note that the ""reply"" or ""answer"" command in your mailer will not work
  for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send
  requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.
  Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com
  address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not
  responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.

BITFTP
------
  For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.
  Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.

Lightwave 3D mail based file-server
-----------------------------------
  A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images
  and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.
  The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list
  and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for
  several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.

  The server resides on a BBS called ""The Graphics BBS"".  The BBS is
  operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1
  908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144
  V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.

  If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,
  please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:
  server@bobsbox.rent.com.

  For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message
  to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in
  the body of the message:
    HELP
    /DIR
  And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete
  directory listing will be sent to you via mail.

[ Now it includes the Cyberware head and shouders in TTDDD format! Check it
 out, only if you can't use FTP! -- nfotis ]

INRIA-GRAPHLIB
--------------
  Pierre Jancene and Sabine Coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail
  server a few months ago.

    echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and 
  how to browse among its files.

    echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the extended summary.

  As an other example :

    echo send cgrl from Misc | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the Computer Graphics Resource Listing mirrored from
  comp.graphics.

BBSes
-----
  There are many BBSes that store datafiles, etc.etc., but a guide to these
  is beyond the scope of this Listing (and the resources of the author!)

7. Scene description languages
==============================

NFF
---
  Neutral file format , by Eric Haines. Very simple, there are some
  procedural database generators in the SPD package, and many objects
  floating in various FTP sites. There's also a previewer written in
  HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there's one written in VOGLE, so you can
  use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.
  (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)

OFF
---
  Object file format, from DEC's Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com).
[ The object archive server seems to be mothballed. In a future version,
 I'll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]

  Available also through their mail server. To obtain help about using this
  service, send a message with a ""Subject:"" line containing only the word
  ""help"" and a null message body to: object-archive-server@decwrl.dec.com.
  [For FTP places to get it, see in the relevant place]. There's an OFF
  previewer for SGI 4D machines, called off-preview in
  godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview,
  also on gondwana.

TDDD
----
It's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF,
Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects.
Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):

  New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley
  (worley@cup.portal.com)

  I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format
  called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,
  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely
  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.

  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file
  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the
  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially
  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various
  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,
  Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables
  for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views
  in Postscript.

P3D
---
  From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight
  extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp
  interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to
  have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.

  The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon
  Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D
  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.

  The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:
  Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,
  Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from
  VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.

  The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines
  ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory
  pub/graphics/programs/p3d.

RenderMan
---------
  Pixar's RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.

==========================================================================

8. Solids description formats
=============================

a. EEC's ESPRIT project 322 CAD*I (CAD Interfaces) has developed a
  neutral file format for transfer of CAD data (curves, surfaces, and
  solid models between CAD systems and from CAD to CAA (Computer Aided
  Analysis) an CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)

b. IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid
  models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987
  For documentation, you might want to contact Nancy Flower at
  NCGA Technical Services and Standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325
  and the cost is $100.
  This standard is not available in electronic format.

c. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only
  the geometrical information, but also for things like FEM, etc.
  The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA. You can get
  more information about PDES by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov
  and putting the line
	send index
  in the body (NOT the Subject:) area of the message.

  The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab.  are also working
  on STEP tools: they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser,
  both available in source form (and for free) for research purposes.
  Soon they will also have an EXPRESS-based database system.

  For the tools contact Mike Mead, Phone: +44 (0235) 44 6710 (FAX: x 5893),
  e-mail: mm@inf.rl.ac.uk or {...!}mcsun!uknet!rlinf!mm or

ONLINE AND OTHER SOURCES OF IMAGES, DATA, ETC.


INTRODUCTION

    A wide variety of images, data, catalogs, information releases, and
    other material dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net.
    A few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access, while the
    remainder support some form of file transfer. Many sites are listed as
    providing 'anonymous FTP'. This refers to the File Transfer Protocol on
    the Internet. Sites not connected to the Internet cannot use FTP
    directly, but there are a few automated FTP servers which operates via
    email. Send mail containing only the word HELP to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com
    or bitftp@pucc.princeton.edu, and the servers will send you instructions
    on how to make requests.

    The sources with the broadest selection of material are the NASA Ames
    SPACE archive and the National Space Science Data Center.

    Don't even ask for images to be posted to the net. The data volume is
    huge and nobody wants to spend the time on it.


VIEWING IMAGES

    The possible combinations of image formats and machines is forebodingly
    large, and I won't attempt to cover common formats (GIF, etc.) here. To
    read PDS and VICAR (and many other) formats on Unix systems running X,
    use XV 2.11, available by anonymous FTP from export.lcs.mit.edu
    (18.24.0.12) in contrib/xv-2.11.tar.Z and the other standard X11 FTP
    sites.

    The FAQ for the Usenet group alt.binaries.pictures discusses image
    formats and how to get image viewing software. A copy of this document
    is available by anonymous FTP from the Usenet FAQ archives at
    pit-manager.mit.edu (18.72.1.58), in directory
    pub/usenet/alt.binaries.pictures.


ONLINE ARCHIVES

    NASA AMES

    Extensive archives are maintained at NASA Ames and are available via
    anonymous FTP or an email server. These archives include many images and
    a wide variety of documents including this FAQ list, NASA press
    releases, shuttle launch advisories, and mission status reports. Please
    note that these are NOT maintained on an official basis.

    FTP users should connect to ames.arc.nasa.gov (128.102.18.3) and look in
    pub/SPACE. pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the
    archive (the index is about 200K by itself).

    To access the archives by email, send a letter to
    archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the
    subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:

	send SPACE Index
	send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91.

    The capitalization of the subdirectory names is important. All are in
    caps. Only text files are handled by the email server at present; use
    one of the FTP email servers described in the introduction to this
    section for images or programs.

    The Magellan Venus and Voyager Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus CD-ROM image
    disks have been put online in the CDROM and CDROM2 directories. The
    disks will be rotated on a weekly basis. Thousands of images are
    available in these collections.

    The GIF directory contains images in GIF format. The VICAR directory
    contains Magellan images in VICAR format (these are also available in
    the GIF directory). A PC program capable of displaying these files is
    found in the IMDISP directory (see the item ""VIEWING IMAGES"" below).

    The NASA media guide describes the various NASA centers and how to
    contact their public affairs officers; this may be useful when pursuing
    specific information. It's in MISC/media.guide.

    Any problems with the archive server should be reported to Peter Yee
    (yee@ames.arc.nasa.gov).


    NASA ASTROPHYSICS DATA SYSTEM

    The ADS is a distributed data retrieval system which is easy to use and
    provides uniform access to ground-based and space-based astronomy data
    from NASA data centers across the country. It currently has over 140
    data catalogs of radio, infrared, optical, UV, and X-ray data which can
    be queried by position or any other parameter in the catalog. The ADS
    also provides tools to manipulate and plot tabular results. In addition,
    ADS has a Beta version of an Abstracts Service which allows users to
    query over 125,000 abstracts of astronomy papers since 1975 by authors,
    keywords, title words, or abstract text words.

    ADS use requires direct Internet access. For more info and to sign up to
    become a user, email ads@cuads.coloradu.edu. The User's Guide and
    ""QuickStart"" Guide are available by anonymous FTP to sao-ftp.harvard.edu
    in directory pub/ads/ADS_User_Guide (PostScript files).

    NASA SPACELINK

    SpaceLink is an online service located at Marshall Space Flight Center
    in Huntsville, Alabama. The system is specifically designed for
    teachers. The data base is arranged to provide easy access to current
    and historical information on NASA aeronautics, space research, and
    technology transfer information. Also included are suggested classroom
    activities that incorporate information on NASA projects to teach a
    number of scientific principles. Unlike bulletin board systems, NASA
    Spacelink does not provide for interaction between callers. However it
    does allow teachers and other callers to leave questions and comments
    for NASA which may be answered by regular mail. Messages are answered
    electronically, even to acknowledge requests which will be fulfilled by
    mail. Messages are generally handled the next working day except during
    missions when turnaround times increase. The mail system is closed-loop
    between the user and NASA.

    SpaceLink also offers downloadable shareware and public domain programs
    useful for science educators as well as space graphics and GIF images
    from NASA's planetary probes and the Hubble Telescope.

    You can dial in at (205)-895-0028 (300/1200/2400/9600(V.32) baud, 8
    bits, no parity, 1 stop bit), or telnet to spacelink.msfc.nasa.gov
    (128.158.13.250, also known as xsl.msfc.nasa.gov) if you're on the
    Internet. Anonymous FTP capability (password guest) is now available.

    Most of this information is also available from the Ames server in
    directory SPACELINK.


    NATIONAL SPACE SCIENCE DATA CENTER (NSSDC)

    The National Space Science Data Center is the official clearinghouse for
    NASA data. The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.
    Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.36.23) and
    log in as 'NODIS' (no password). You can also get the catalog by sending
    email to 'request@nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov'.

    You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,
    no parity, one stop). At the ""Enter Number:"" prompt, enter MD and
    carriage return. When the system responds ""Call Complete,"" enter a few
    more carriage returns to get the ""Username:"" and log in as 'NODIS' (no
    password).

    The system is menu-driven; topics available as of 3/93 are:

	    (IUE,IRAS,HST,NTT...).
	- Spectra and images (IUE, HST).
	- Most of the astronomical catalogues (SAO, HR, NGC, PPM, IRAS,
	    Veron, GSC and many others, more than 50) in a very convenient
	    way (give center+radius+kind of objects, and you get the
	    corresponding files!).

    Log on as ``starcat'' (no password) on node stesis.hq.eso.org
    (134.171.8.100) or on STESIS (DECnet). The files created can be
    retreived by FTP. Contact: Benoit Pirenne, bpirenne@eso.org (phone +49
    89 320 06 433) at ST-ECF


    ASTRONOMICAL DATABASES

    The full SAO stellar database is *NOT* available online, probably due to
    the 40 MB size. It may be ordered on magnetic tape from the NSSDC. A
    subset containing position and magnitude only is available by FTP (see
    ""Astronomy Programs"" below).

    nic.funet.fi (128.214.6.100) has a large collection of astronomical
    programs for many types of computers, databases of stars and deep sky
    objects, and general astronomy information in directory /pub/astro. This
    site is mainly for European users, but overseas connections are
    possible.

    The Ames archives contain a database of 8,436 galaxies including name,
    RA, declination, magnitude, and radial velocity in MISC/galaxy.dat.
    Supplied by Wayne Hayes (wayne@csri.utoronto.ca).

    iris1.ucis.dal.ca (129.173.18.107) has a number of GIFs from Voyager,
    Hubble, and other sources available by anonymous FTP in pub/gif (most of
    this data is also in SPACE/GIF on the Ames server). Please restrict
    access to 5pm - 8am Atlantic time.

    pomona.claremont.edu has the Yale Bright Star catalog for anonymous FTP
    in directory [.YALE_BSC]. Contact James Dishaw

    The ""Variable Stars Analysis Software Archive"" is available via
    anonymous FTP from kauri.vuw.ac.nz (130.195.11.3) in directory
    pub/astrophys. This is intended for specialists in this field, and they
    would appreciate people from outside New Zealand confining their FTP
    access to the astrophys directory, as they pay a significant amount for
    Internet access. Contents are relatively sparse at present due to the
    youth of the archive - contributions are encouraged. Contact the archive
    administrator, Timothy Banks (bankst@kauri.vuw.ac.nz) for more
    information.

    The ""IDL Astronomy Users Library"" is available by anonymous FTP from

    Copies of back issues of Space Digest are archived on
    LISTSERV@UGA.BITNET. Send mail containing the message ""INDEX SPACE"" to
    get an index of files; send it the message ""GET filename filetype"" to
    get a particular file.


LANDSAT AND NASA PHOTOS

    You can get black-and-white 1:1M prints, negatives, or positives for
    $10, $18, $12 respectively for any Landsat data more than 2 years old
    from EDC, (Eros (Earth Resources Orbiting Satellite) Data Center). Call
    them at (605)-594-6511. You get 80 meter resolution from the MSS
    scanner, 135x180 kilometers on a picture 135x180 mm in size. I think you
    have to select one band from (green, red, near IR, second near IR), but
    I'm not sure. Digitial data is also available at higher prices.

    Transparencies of all NASA photos available to the public can be
    borrowed from the NASA photo archive; you can have copies or prints
    made.

PLANETARY MAPS

    The USGS address for maps of the planets is:

    U.S. Geological Survey,
    Distribution Branch,
    Box 25286, Federal Center, Bldg. 41
    Denver, CO 80225

    Maps cost $2.40 to $3.10 per sheet (a few come in sets of 2 or 3 sheets).

    The best global maps of Mars based on Viking images are 1:15,000,000
    scale in 3 sheets. These maps are:

    I-1535 (2 sheets only) - relief, albedo, names
    I-1535
    I-1618 (3 sheets) - relief, names
    I-2030 (3 sheets) - relief, topographic contours
    I-1802-A,B,C (3 sheets) - geology

    There are many other maps as well: 30 sheets at 1:5,000,000 scale in
    relief, albedo, geology, photomosaic forms (not all 30 sheets available
    in all formats); 140 sheets at 1:2,000,000 scale as photomosaics of the
    whole planet, about 100 sheets of interesting sites at 1:500,000 scale
    in photomosaic format, and lots of special sheets.

    Then there are maps of Mercury, Venus, the Moon, the four Galilean
    Satellites, six moons of Saturn and five of Uranus. [Phil Stooke
    (stooke@vaxr.sscl.uwo.ca), the author of this item, has offered to
    respond to email requests for information on any topic relating to lunar
    and planetary maps.]

    Center announce the sixth edition of the Catalogue of Cometary Orbits in
    IAU Circular 4935. The catalogue contains 1292 entries which represent
    all known comets through November 1989 and is 96 pages long.
    Non-subscribers to the Circulars may purchase the catalogue for $15.00
    while the cost to subscribers is $7.50. The basic catalogue in ASCII
    along with a program to extract specific orbits and calculate
    ephemerides is available on MS-DOS 5.25-inch 2S2D diskette at a cost of
    $75.00 (the program requires an 8087 math coprocessor). The catalogue
    alone is also available by e-mail for $37.50 or on magnetic tape for
    $300.00.

    Except for the printed version of the catalogue, the various magnetic
    media or e-mail forms of the catalogue do not specifically meantion
    non-subscribers. It is possible that these forms of the catalogue may
    not be available to non-subscribers or that their prices may be more
    expensive than those given. Mail requests for specific information and

That is true.  It is also none of your business.

/(hudson)
/And why is there nothing wrong with it?  Because you say so?  Who gave you
/the authority to say that, and set the standard for morality?

Why?

Because: 
I am a living, thinking person able to make choices for myself.
I do not ""need"" you to show me what you think is the way; I have observed
too many errors in your thinking already to trust you to make up the
rules for me.

Because:
I set the standard for my *own* morality, and I permit you to do 
the same for yourself.  I also do not try to force you to accept my rules.

Because:
Simply because you don't like what other people are doing doesn't give you
the right to stop it, Hudson.  We are all aware that you would like for 
everyone to be like you.  However, it is obnoxious, arrogant thinking like 
yours, the ""I-know-I'm-morally-right-so-I-can-force-it-on-you"" bullshit 
that has brought us religious wars, pogroms against Jews, gay-bashing,
and other atrocities by other people who, like you, ""knew"" they were
morally right.

/(hudson)
/Aren't you?  Aren't you indicating that I should not tell other people what
to do?  Aren't you telling me it is wrong for me to do that? 

It is not a moral standard that I am presenting you with, Hudson.  It is
a key to getting along in life with other people.  It is also a point of
respect:  I trust other people to be intelligent enough to make their
own choices, and I expect the same to be returned.  You, on the other
hand, do not trust them, and want to make the choice for them--whether
they like it or not.

It is also a way to avoid an inconsistency:  if you believe that you have 
the right to set moral standards for others and interfere in their lives, 
then you must, by logic, admit that other people have the same right of 
interference in your life.  
(Yes, I know; you will say that your religion is correct and tells you that
only agents acting in behalf of your religion have the right of interference.
However, other people will say that you have misinterpreted the Word of
God and that *they* are the actual true believers, and that you are
acting on your own authority.  And so it goes).

"Here is a copy of my first update on the Randy Weaver trial.
After a large response (about 15 email messages), I've decided
that there is sufficient interest here on t.p.g. to warrant
posting.

*** file follows *** 

Hi Folks;

As perhaps the only Boise resident on the list, I guess it
kind of falls on me to keep people updated about the
Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial.

Yesterday marked the seating of the jury.  Apparently no other
legal activities occurred.  The jury was selected and things
start today.

More interesting is what happenned outside.  About a dozen
Weaver supporters showed up to stage a protest outside the
courthouse.  One woman carried a sign that read, ""Who stands
trial for the murder of Vicki and (son's name - I forget)
Weaver?""  On the evening news she said, ""I am here protesting
because I believe in freedom of speech and freedom of religion.
I thought we all did.""  Nice sound bite (grin)!

The news reporter also interviewed some guy named ""Tim""
who refused to give his last name.  Not to prejudge the
guy, but he looked like a neo-nazi.  He also said he
expected many neo-nazis to show up throughout the trial.
""Tim"" had been handing out leaflets in support of Weaver
and Harris and the news had footage of a Boise cop
telling him to move along or he'd arrest.  I don't know
the finer points of this one.  Perhaps there's a law
against political activity within X feet of a courthouse
or something (what happenned to the First Amendment?!?).

Most ominous of all was that the local reporter filmed
an agent of the Gestapo...err...ATF with a minicam
FILMING THE PROTESTORS!  Welcome to the world of Big Brother.

Anyhow, Gerry Spence came out and asked the protestors to
leave because he didn't think it would help Weaver's case
any.  He said he was confident that, once the evidence
came out, that Weaver would be aquitted.

"Brian Yamauchi asks: [Regarding orbital billboards...]
  
    Well, I had been collecting data for next edition of the
Commercial Space News/Space Technology Investor... To summarize:
  
SPACE ADVERTISING
    First, advertising on space vehicles is not new -- it is very
common practice to put the cooperating organization's logos on the
space launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GPS launcher had the
(very prominent) logos on its side of
   - McDonnell Douglas (the Delta launcher)
   - Rockwell International (who built the GPS satellite)
   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and
   - the GPS/Navstar program office
   This has not been considered ""paid advertising"" but rather
""public relations"", since the restrictions have been such that only
organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the
side, and there was no money exchanged for this.  [However, putting
a 10' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras
is ""advertising"" as much as it is ""public relations"", in my
opinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle has
rather prominent McDonnell-Douglas and SDIO logos on the side...]
   There have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials
for use of space vehicles for advertising, or placing large
advertising signs in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of
several serious studies in the early and mid 1980's which looked at
putting logos on the external tank, or on the sides of the payload
bay.  These ventures would be different than ""public relations"", in
that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms
participating on that flight, and would involve payment of sums for
the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization.  (For
example, painting the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putting a
Disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras
would scan past it.)
  
ADVERTS ON LAUNCH VEHICLES
   The first paid advertising was done on a Soviet launcher in about
1990, when several non-involved foreign organizations were allowed
to pay to put their logos on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe
company was one of the first advertisers, I remember.)  Similarly,
Soviet cosmonauts on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last
Olympic games, and have gleefully shown banners and other items from
participating firms and organizations.  Mars candy bars, for
example, got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the
British visiting cosmonaut to Mir.
   Now US firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch
vehicles.  The upcoming Conestoga launch (in June) putting the COMET
recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements
on the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger's upcoming movie ""The Last
Action Hero"".  Besides the usual logos of the participating
organizations, Columbia pictures has paid $500,000 to put ads on the
main fuselage of the mission's Conestoga rocket, its booster
rockets, and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for
one month.  A concept for this advertising display was published in
Space News magazine a couple of months ago.
   (As a side note: Robert Lorsch, an advertising executive, is
talking about suing NASA.  He charges NASA with appropriating an idea he
created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising
sponsorships on NASA spacecraft as a way to get funding for the
space program.  Lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on
the upcoming COMET, NASA violated an agreement that it ""would not use
his idea without him being the exclusive representative for NASA and
receiving compensation.""   This is being disputed, since the launch
is a ""commercial launch"" and NASA is receiving none of the
advertising revenues, but the funding for the COMET program is
coming from NASA.)
  
ORBITAL ""BILLBOARDS""
   Orbital ""billboards"" have been the staple of science fiction for
some time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert
Heinlein described another in ""The Man Who Sold the Moon"".  Several
different potential projects have been developed, although none have
been implemented, but the most real prior to 1993 being the ""Eiffel
II"" project, which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in
orbit to celebrate the French Republic's Bi-centennial.

Yes, I agree the first half of the amendment does modify the noun

	to qualify or limit the meaning of.  For example, ""wet""
	modifes ""day"" in the phrase ""a wet day.""

The amendment is similiar to the statement:
	A wet day, being annoying, the right of the people to keep
	and wear boots, shall not be infringed.
So how does a dry day pertain the right to use boots?  Similiar,
what does the ""unorganized militia"" have to due with the right to

No not, unconditional, but ""shall not be infringed"".  Infringed
is defined as:
	To break or ignore the terms of or obligations (an oath, 
	an agreement, law, or the like); to disreguard; violate.
	To go beyond the boundaries or limits; tresspass; encroach.
This definition implies the following of some form of existing 
agreement.  Laws and agreements are made in advance.  Boundaries 
or limits of behavior are set by society as a whole.  The word 
""unconditional"" implies no agreements or all previous agreements 
are off, which is the opposite.

The words used in the first amendment are much stronger, i.e.,
""congress shall make no law,"" are much stronger.  They clearly 
	         ^^^^^^^^^^^
imply ""unconditional.""  If the writers of the amendment, wanted 
unconditional whay didn't they says, ""congress shall make no 
laws pertaining the the right of the people to keep and bear arms""?
The second amendment implies a sort contract between the people
the people and the state.  The bigger part of the contract is
the people have the right to overthrew the government and its laws
at any time.  To guarantee this right, the laws cannot stopped
the people from forming a ""well regutaled militia.""  The duties
of a ""well regulated militia"" to the government are descussed in 
Federalist No. 29.  And the limits of of the governmental control
of the militia are descussed in Article I Section 8, Article II 
Section 2, and the Second Amendment of the constitution.

In spite of my great respect for the people you speak of, I think their
cost estimates are a bit over-optimistic. If nothing else, a working SSTO
is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience
base. It therefore seems that SSTO development should cost at least as
much as a typical airliner development. That puts it in the $3G to $5G
range.


True it and the contest would result in a much larger market. But I
don't think it would be enough to attract the investors given the
risks involved.

If you could gurantee the SSTO costs and gurantee that it captures
100% of the available launch market, then I think you could
do it.

Not to mention last year's Weaver affair.

Anyway, here's how I see the Waco affair; I'd be interested in other peoples'
interpretations...

1. Koresh and his people were basically minding their own business.
2. Some weapons violations may have been committed and I wouldn't have
   disapproved of prosecuting him for those violations.  However, I think
   the BATF was criminal for starting negotiations with a military style
   assault and for firing into a house where there were children and other
   noncombatants.
3. I don't see they couldn't just leave a token guard on the place and wait
   the BDs out; I don't approve of the tear gas approach and, if it caused
   the fire to be started, I think the FBI agent responsible should spend
   10-20 years in jail.
4. However, if Koresh's response to the tear gas was to kill everyone there,
   I hold him largely responsible for their deaths.",politics

No, but I have several other breakdowns of accidental shootings.
I've never seen one that specifically provides the info that Davis insists
that he has, so I'd love to have a cite.


Wrong.  There's one gun design where that can happen, and it is
supposed to be carried with the hammer over an unloaded chamber.
(Cocking the gun turns the cylinder so that a loaded cylinder is under
the hammer.  In other words, it can be usefully carried in a safe
manner.)  Other handgun designs don't have that property; if their
trigger isn't pulled, the hammer can't hit the firing pin.


The breakdowns that I do have include the above category.  From them I
can safely say that if Davis is right in ALL of his claims, a large
negative number of people are killed by animals, because we know that
the number of killings by wackos is reasonably large and that the
number of accidents due to gun failures (which is a superset of the
described circumstance) is near zero.


Please do.  Include a cite for those of us who like looking at
context.  Make sure that your source excludes other types of
accidents and suicides that are misreported.  (""Gun cleaning

"Press Release No.19-93
Paris, 22 April 1993

Users of ESA's Olympus satellite report on the outcome of
their experiments

""Today Europe's space telecommunications sector would not
be blossoming as it now does, had OLYMPUS not provided
a testbed for the technologies and services of the 1990s"". This
summarises the general conclusions of 135 speakers and 300
participants at the Conference on Olympus Utilisation held in
Seville on 20-22-April 1993. The conference was organised by
the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Spanish Centre for
the Development of Industrial Technology (CDTI).

OLYMPUS has been particularly useful :
-      in bringing satellite telecommunications to thousands of
       new users, thanks to satellite terminals with very small
       antennas (VSATs). OLYMPUS experiments have tested
       data transmission, videoconferencing, business television,
       distance teaching and rural telephony, to give but a few
       examples.

-      in opening the door to new telecommunications services
       which could not be accommodated on the crowded lower-
       frequency bands; OLYMPUS was the first satellite over
       Europe to offer capacity in the 20/30 GHz band.

-      in establishing two-way data relay links  OLYMPUS
       received for the first time in Europe, over several months,
       high-volume data from a low-Earth orbiting spacecraft and
       then distributed it to various centres in Europe.

When OLYMPUS was launched on 12 July 1989 it was the
world's largest telecommunications satellite; and no other
satellite has yet equalled its versatility in combining four
different payloads in a wide variety of frequency bands.

OLYMPUS users range from individual experimenters to some
of the world's largest businesses. Access to the satellite is
given in order to test new telecommunications techniques or
services; over the past four years some 200 companies and
organisations made use of this opportunity, as well as over
100 members of the EUROSTEP distance-learning
organisation.



As the new technologies and services tested by these
OLYMPUS users enter the commercial market, they then
make use of operational satellites such as those of

"There is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today's
LA Times (Thursday April 15, 1993, p. D1).  I thought I'd post it to
stir up some flame wars - I mean reasoned debate.  Let me preface it by
saying that I largely agree that the ""Space Age"" in the romantic sense
of several decades ago is over, and that projects like the space station
miss the point at this time.  Reading, for example, ""What's New"" -
the weekly physics update we get here on the net - it's clear that the
romance of the day lies in the ever more fine-grained manipulation of
matter: by which I include biotechnology, condensed matter physics (with
its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amazing things
people are doing with individual atoms these days.  To a large extent, I
think, the romance some people still have with space is a matter of
nostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precisely, our ""mind
children"" - will spread across space (unless we wipe ourselves out); but
I think that *manned* space exploration is not what is exciting about
what we can do *now*.   

Anyway, let me quote some of this article, but not all...


SPACE AGE GLORY FADES FROM VIEW

Micheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)

At 35, America's Space Age won't have to suffer through the angst of a
midlife crisis.

The reason is that the Space Age is already dead.  The technologies no
longer define our times, and the public has grown weary of the multibillion
-dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic
rewards.  

Space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of America's science
and technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace is not a
meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate, our
technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion
policy.  

To be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologies
for telecommunications and remote sensing - cheap deep-space probes
would be nice too - but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of
scientific and industrial innovation is now dead.

.....

Before the change in administrations, it would have been foolish to
write an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressively
supported the space program and proposed spending well over $30 billion
to build space station Freedom alone.

Even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains,
Office of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman was an outspoken
public champion of big-ticket space expenditures.  The reality that much
of the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope
to the space station - was poorly conceived and unimpressively
implemented did not seem to matter much.

Political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent
vision or cost-effective sensibilities - determined multibillion-dollar
space budgets.

Indeed, with few notable exceptions, such as Voyager, the post-Apollo
era is the story of the gold-plated porkification of space exploration
with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more.  

......

While the Clinton Administration has kept on the highly regarded Daniel
Goldin as administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration, it seems clear that space exploration is not being
positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America's
technological prowess.  The space station budget has - rightly - been
slashed.  Space is virtually ignored when the Administration champions
its competitiveness agenda.

                         xxxx    xxxx
                             xxxx

The good thing about this perspective is that you can look and move
around in three dimensions and still maintain your peripheral vision. [*]

Since your viewpoint is always the same, the routines can be hard-coded
for a particular vantage.  In my case, wall two's rising edge has a slope
of 1/4. (I'm also using Mode X, 320x240).

I've run into two problems; I'm sure that other readers have tried this
before, and have perhaps formulated their own opinions:

1) The routines for drawing walls 1 & 2 were trivial, but when I ran a
packed->planar image through them, I was dismayed by the ""jaggies.""  I'm
now considered some anti-aliasing routines (speed is not really necessary).
Is it worth the effort to have the artist draw the wall already skewed,
thus being assured of nice image, or is this too much of a burden?

2) Wall 3 presents a problem; the algorithm I used tends to overly distort
the original.  I tried to decide on paper what pixels go where, and failed.
Has anyone come up with method for mapping a planar to crosswise sheared
shape?

Currently I take:

  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32
 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48
 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64

and produce:
            
             1  2  3  4
33 34 35 36 17 18 19 20  5  6  7  8
49 50 51 52 37 38 39 40 21 22 23 24  9 10 11 12
            53 54 55 56 41 42 43 44 25 26 27 28 13 14 15 16
                        57 58 59 60 45 46 47 48 29 30 31 32
                                    61 62 63 64

Line 1 follows the slope.  Line 2 is directly under line 1.
Line 3 moves up a line and left 4 pixels.  Line 4 is under line 3.
This fills the shape exactly without any unfilled pixels.  But
it causes distortions.  Has anyone come up with a better way?
Perhaps it is necessary to simply draw the original bitmap
already skewed?

Are there any other particularly sticky problems with this perspective?
I was planning on having hidden plane removal by using z-buffering.
Locations are stored in (x,y,z) form.

[*] For those of you who noticed, the top lines of wall 2 (and wall 1)
*are* parallel with its bottom lines.  This is why there appears to
be an optical illusion (ie. it appears to be either the inside or outside
of a cube, depending on your mood).  There are no vanishing points.
This simplifies the drawing code for objects (which don't have to
change size as they move about in the room).  I've decided that this
approximation is alright, since small displacements at a large enough
distance cause very little change in the apparent size of an object in
a real perspective drawing.

Hopefully the ""context"" of the picture (ie. chairs on the floor, torches
hanging on the walls) will dispell any visual ambiguity.

No. The issue is reducing crime, not guns. If gun control doesn't
lower crime overall, then is doesn't address the issue.


Does that matter if assaults with a baseball bat become much
more common? Muggers using a gun rely primarily on the
threat of the gun, and rarely shoot their victim. A mugger
using a knife is much more likely to start by stabbing his victim 
in an effort incapacitate him. So, while a knif may not
be as deadly as a gun, criminals are more likely to actually
_use_ the knife (as opposed to threatening the victim with it.)
It isn't at all clear that replacing the criminal's gun with a
knife would reduce murders. Stabbings might just become more
common. That's why it is important to look at the overall
(not the with-gun) homicide rate. It avoids the issue of
substitution, different criminal techinques of using different
weapons, etc... and measures what we want to prevent: Murders.


""Face""? Possibly. However, facing knife-welding attackers isn't
too common: Stabbing without warning and by supprise is the
usual tactic. Very few criminals shoot from cover: It attracts
to much attention and they don't have a chance to go through your
pockets. Overall, I'd much rather be threatened with a gun
than actually stabbed with a knife.


Actually, the exact same statement is true of guns: Training in
unarmed self-defence will let you disarm an untrained gunman 
without much problem.

You also ignore the criminal's reaction: The National Crime
Survey clearly shows that criminals (unarmed, armed with a
knife, gun or whatever) are unwilling to risk their lives
in a confrontation. If faced with a serious threat, almost
all prefer to leave and find an easier target. Therefore,
using (or threatening to use, as is much more commonly the case)
a weapon _is_ the best defence against an attacker, regardless
of how he is armed. Knives, however, are much less effective
than guns: Criminals don't consider knifes as a ""serious threat""
nearly as often as they do guns.",politics

"Having run completely out of time, I've got to get my prophesies and
predictions for the A.L. out.  Qualifications -- one of the worse
finishes in last year's prediction contest.

AL East -- 1993

1.  Baltimore Orioles
Why the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to
this:
  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.
  -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees
  -- Milwaukee was a fluke
  -- Indians aren't ready to contend
  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better
  -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of ""replacement level""
""But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.""  No.  As a matter
of fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division
on paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-
body has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  ""You don't really think that Brady
Anderson is going to repeat, do you?""  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction
on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  ""Glenn
Davis?  That's insane"".  Yes.  So, without further ado:
STRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.
WEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be
  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.
  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize
  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3
  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.
ObPrediction:  ""The Streak"" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in
  caught stealing.

2. New York Yankees.
STRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American
  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.
WEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner 
  factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far
  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to

3.  Toronto Blue Jays
STRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie
  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.
  Guzman.  Alomar.
WEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.
  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in
  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.
ObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And
  have a losing record.

4.  Milwaukee Brewers
STRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.
WEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year.

WEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix
  Fermin.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace.
ObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.

6.  Boston Red Sox
STRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens
WEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre
  Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL
ObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how
  you will :->

7.  Detroit Tigers
STRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker
WEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.
  Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.
  This year could be *very* ugly.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP.

He also ignores a few other things.  While organics would become
significantly more expensive were all the oil to disappear (and thus
some things would no longer be economically feasible), oil is hardly
an irreplaceable resource any more than most other consumables.  As
supply decreases, prices rise and alternatives become more
competetive.  He also needs to consider that there has been an
estimated 30 years of reserves pretty much as long as anyone has cared
about petroleum; whatever the current usage rate is, we always seem to
have about a 30 year reserve that we know about.

[I'm not sure that last figure is still true -- we tend not to look as
hard when prices are comparatively cheap -- but it was certainly true
during hte 'oil crisis' days of the 70's.]

Lefebvre pinch hit for Rick Wilkins with TOMMY SHIELDS! How can you do that
just because of the lefty-righty thing, too much is made of that. Wilkins is
twice the hitter that Shields is. Then the next batter was Jose Vizcaino, one
of the weakest hitters I have ever seen, and who had looked terrible at bat all

Every city and suburban police officer I've seen around the Twin Cities in the
last two years has carried a semi-auto of some type (different brands though
I haven't seen any Glock's). 

With regard to this discussion:  We are getting dangerously far from the usual
rantings of t.p.g, and close to the realm of r.g, but I'd like to put my two
cents worth in.  While there's nothing wrong with a revolver (especially a 
large frame S&W in .357 magnum - my favorite) there are valid advantages to
semi-autos.  I suggest reading Massad Ayoob's (I know, some people can't stand
him and think he's full of bull, but I think that in general his material is
very valid and useful) book _The Semi Auto Pistol in Police Work_ (or something 
like that).  He defines a number of ways that semi-auto's are different, and that
""different is good"".  The main advantage is not in increased firepower, but in 
more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode.  There is also a
certain ""propriatory nature"" of each gun that takes some familiarity to 
learn.  This may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar
with different models of semi-autos, but it was cited as stopping or at least
slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun.


Yes, but this is best done with a two hand hold.  With a single hand you either
pull the gun far off target to cock, or must fire double action.  The DA semi
auto has the same advantages plus is always SA after the first shot.



I'm not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point.  In a DA
semi-auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same
round - an advantage you don't have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will
always go to the next round (discussing this point now).  This is fine with a dud
but what about a hangfire situation?  Granted it's very rare, but your round will
now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go.  Slingshotting the slide
on a misfire takes very little time.



Actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not
necessary or usually recommended.  A revolver would have to fall hard enough and
at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the
round to set it off.


The best speedloader users, especially those using the spring loaded speed
loaders are very fast.  A problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two
handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed.  This means that
while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the
gun, with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always 
take more time.  You also don't have the advantage of tactical reloads (replacing
a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity - the partial magazine can
still be used if needed later).  


Yes, the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear
it.  Really though, in either a revolver or semi-auto the odds of an actual misfire
with factory ammo are awfully small.  You are more likely to get a jam in a semi-auto
but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns (Sigs, Glocks, et.al.).




All common semi-auto's can be carried with a round in their chamber without any
safety problems.  While I put that out as a statement that I believe, I should
say that this applies to all of the ones I've looked at.  For the DA semi's it's
no different from the revolver situation:  The guns all have hammer or firing
pin blocks.  They also have a safety.  Because there's no real advantage
carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed
of employment as a revolver, plus the advantage of SA followup shots.  I'm
not familiar with SA semi-autos except for the 1911-A1.  I admit that I was
initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked, but after examining
the design, trying to defeat the safeties (gun unloaded of course), and 
shooting it a lot, I see no inherent safety problems with it, especially in
a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer.  This design also gets
you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver.


Yeah, the infamous Glock.  I still can't figure out how it's worse than a revolver
for safety.  If you don't pull the trigger it doesn't go off.  I imagine that if all
your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the Glock trigger
far enough to fire before you realized it.  In addition, if you had developed that
nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and
relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew
off your foot then you'd have problems when the hammer wasn't there.


I think this is even okay for a riot (as long as it's a small one B^)).


I have the poor man's Beretta (Taurus 99) and consider it inferior as a carry
weapon to the Springfield .45 (oops, 9mm vs. 45 arguments are relegated to
r.g).  You are right, though.  If you don't hit what you aim at then the
shooter/gun combination has failed.  I don't ascribe failures in the the
fire real fast with a wonder-nine scenario you mention to the gun.  This is
a shooter failure, whether through lack of discipline or lack of training.



9mm's are becoming more popular with crooks too, though the .38 does still
lead the list.  And like I said, around here semi-auto's seem the rule for the
street cop.  Don't know about the State Patrol however, they may still carry
the ""Highway Patrolman"".

like $2.00) worth.  And much of it is IMHO, but do check Ayoob's book.",politics

Actually, jon, that is quite true.  Christian people have caused
""objective morality"" to look very ""relative.""  After all, that was the
point of the original question in this thread, i.e. can we toss out
Christianity because it is so obviously inconsistent with its own
principles?  If you will bear with me, I will attempt to explain this
apparent inconsistency from at least one Christian's viewpoint:

If God exists and is the creator of mankind as the Bible claims, then
He has a pretty well-defined concept of what makes people tick
physically, emotionally, etc.  GOD has an ""objective"" morality for us.
That is to say, He has no trouble understanding what is good for (or
detrimental to) the creature He created. 

	Galatians 2:10-- For we [mankind] are His workmanship, created in
	Christ Jesus for good works [a morality], which God prepared
	beforehand [a well-defined design], that we might walk in them.

However, contrary to what many people assume (including the Pharasees
of the Bible,) God's morality cannot be completely codified in a list
of rules and regulations.  To some extent, every activity of a
person's life creates a new situation to which morality must be
applied.  There never could be enough volumes to codify God's
""objective"" morality for us. 

Throughout history, mankind has tried to reduce morality to a list of
rules (objectivity, if you please.)  In the Old Testament, we have
both principles and specific rules.  By the time of Jesus, most of the
principles were obscured by the emphasis men had placed on the rules.
Volumes of additional rules had been made to try to codify the
application of the principles.  We [mankind] weren't comfortable with
the ""subjectivity"" of principles. 

	For reference see Matthew 5 where Jesus explains the difference
	between the Law and the principles of the Law.  For example, in
	verses 21-22:  ""You have heard that the ancients were told,
	'You shall not commit murder'...and 'Whoever commits murder shall
	be liable to the court.'  But I say to you that everyone who is
	angry with his brother shall be liable to the court...""

The ""objective morality"" of God gets blurred by our inept
interpretation of it.  We [Christians] have made our biggest errors
when we have allowed any one person or group of people decide EXACTLY
what God intended for us.  If we [Christians] would stay committed to
seeking God's will instead of trying to prove we already had it all
figured out, we might do a better job of allowing others to find God's
""objective morality"" for themselves.  If Jesus is who he said he
was/is (and that's the fundamental question,) then HE IS ""objective
morality."" ",religion

illegal to manufacture, sell, or import them in this coutry,  let me use
a parallel for empiric evidence.  The amount of cocaine in this country is

"I told some friends of mine two weeks ago that Koresh was dead.  The FBI and
the BATF could not let a man like that live.  He was a testimonial to their
stupidity and lies.    

Now before everyone gets crazy with me, let me say that Koresh was crazy as 
a bed bug, but out government was crazier...and they lied to us.

They told us compound had been under survaillance for quite some time.  Yet, 
whoever was watching the place failed to see that Koresh went jogging and into
town on a regular basis.  Everyone in the area claimed to have seen him and 
wondered why they didn't pick him up then.  There are two possible answers.
First, they didn't see him.  What kind of survaillance is that?  Second, they
didn't care.  They wanted a confrontation.  They wanted publicity and they got
it.

After the first battle, they told us that they did not know he knew they were
coming.  They also said it would have been foolish to go in knowing that.
Well, we know now that they intercepted the informants call and went in anyway.

Did they explore all of the possibilities for ending the seige?  According to
them they did, but according to the Hartford Courant, the woman that raised
Koresh (His Grandmother) was not allowed to go in and see him.                 
 The FBI agent who she spoke with was Bob Ricks and according to the paper he

""A lot of people think if you just talk to them logically they will come out.
His grandmother raised Vernon Howell; (Koresh's Real name)  she didn't raise
David Koresh.""

Someone who raises you and loves you does not speak to you strickly on a
logical level.  There is also an emotional level on which they can reach you.

Here's another one.  All during this operation the FBI has been claiming that
they feared a mass suicide and that is one of the reasons that something must
be done.  Now they claim they never thought he would do it?

I knew they were going to do something when they started talking about how
much money this was costing.  That was the start of the ""Justification"" part
part of the plan.  That's when I knew it would come soon.

But, back to the plan.  It is considered ""Cruel and Unusal Punishment"" to
execute criminals in the minds of many people, but look at what's acceptable.

They knew the parents (adults) had gas masks.  They did not know, or were not
sure, if the children had them.  So the plan was to pour the gas into the 
compound.  The mothers, seeing what the gas was doing to their children were
supposed to run out and that would only leave the men to deal with.

I spent two years in the army and like everyother veteran I went through CBR
(Chemical, Biological Radiological) warfare training.  Part of that training
is going into a room filled with the same stuff that the children were
subjected to.  To make the stuff really interesting the gas also has a chemical 
agent that irritates the skin.  You think its on fire.

I have no doubts the children would become hysterical.  Its not the kind of
thing you never want to do again.  This was the plan, the final solution.

We waited 444 days for our hostages to come home from Iran.  We gave these
people 51 days.  

I stated on several occasions that there was absolutely nothing in this whole
thing that the government could point to as a success.  Well, FBI agent Ricks
changed my mind.  Again a newclip from the Hartford Courant:

""And while expressing regret at the loss of life, he suggested that the
operation had been at least a modified success because not a single federal
shot had been fired and not a single federal agent had been hurt.""

It took 17 dead children to get us that new definition of success.

One more thought.  The government claimed that they believed he had automatic
weapons on the premises. 
                                                      
        HE HAD A LICENSE FOR THE 50 CALIBER MACHINE GUN!

THEY KNEW DAMN WELL HE HAD ONE. THEY ALSO KNEW HE HAD IT LEGALLY!

Still, without the element of surprise they sent in agents to get him.

This is what Jackson looked like in 88-91, with everything converted
to a neutral park, on the basis of run production. His equivalent
average started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So
let us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level
of play.

That is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the top
ten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was Dave
Winfield's .296; Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds,
an incroyable .378; tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is better
than any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about what
Mattingly had in 1988 (.285); what Felix Jose had the last two years;
just ahead of Time Raines' five-year average; better than Ryan
Klesko's MLEs. 

He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his
baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting.
That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The
media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a
good, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th best
hitter in the majors.",sport
"I do not think it is at all unlikely that Clinton ro his policy
wonk facilitators arranged the Waco raid as a display piece for  the
Gun War on the Constitution.  Look at what the Bush administration did to
get material for the Drug War on the Constitution--remember that baggie of
crack George waved at the cameras?  They took a dealer from the ghetto
and brought him to the White House so they could say drugs had been
dealt onb the White House Lawn.
And I don't think anybody could honestly think Clinton would have any
moral qualms about the raid...
The only really worrisome thing is that the BD's heroic defense of
their ranch will make Clinton's Gun War on the Constitution _more_
successfull--exactly as he wanted.  The media and politicians will
filter this so that the general public will think the BD's
are bad guys!  Don't help them.  Stand up for the BD's with your
friends and family adnd in public anytime you can--their supposed
moral qualms are not important to the issue.  They are heroes in the

"What are the main advantages of this method?  I have seen it described, and
the algiorithm seems a  little bit long.  I developed my own method, which
requires that the points be in a counter-clockwise order, and returns
whether you are looking at the back or the front, similar to the plane eqn
method.  It uses few calculations however, basically it is several
comparisons.  The only disadvantage I see is that it must be done after the
transformation from view coordinates to coordinates to display on the
screen, which means that a little more calculation isneeded beforehand.  My
method basically figures out whether the points that will appear on the
screen are clockwise or counterclockwise.  When looking at the back of
something, the points occur in an opposite direction from the front, so
merely by figuring out which way the points go, you can tell whether you are
looking at the back or front of a 2d polygon.  Has anyone heard of this
method before?  It is so simple, I doubt i am the first to think of it.

I've noticed that if you only save a model (with all your mapping planes
positioned carefully) to a .3DS file that when you reload it after restarting
3DS, they are given a default position and orientation.  But if you save

know why this information is not stored in the .3DS file?  Nothing is
explicitly said in the manual about saving texture rules in the .PRJ file.

Are you sure about this? I'm currently looking at a copy of last 
Thursday's SF Chronicle and there is the typical one column Traders
ad on page C7 in the Sports section. Not only that, but there is
a part in the middle which rather prominently says ""WANTED: We pay
cash for assault rifles and pistols."". Granted, I haven't seen today's
paper yet. But I'd be surprised if there wasn't a Traders ad in it.
It's probably worth it to write to the Chronicle (and other papers)
anyway, because all their anti-gun editorials are disgusting.

By the way, let me put in a plug for Traders. I have shopped all
over the SF Bay Area and I have never seen another store with lower
prices. And their selection is amazing.

It's supposedly a high-performance chip based upon workstation graphics
accelerators.  It's quite fast (I have 7), but as usual with new boards/chips
the drivers are buggy for Windows.  As far as Winmarks go, it depends upon

As far as the low-level stuff goes, it looks pretty nice.  It's got this

"oldham@ces.cwru.edu (Daniel Oldham) babbles:

What happened in Waco is not the fault of the BATF. If they would of
had the proper equipment and personal then they could of captured the
compound on the initial assault and none of this would of happened.

	If they'd gone to the door and knocked on it to serve the
	warrant, like the Sheriff had done 3 other times, they
	wouldn't have needed to HAVE an initial assault.  But then,
	Herr Klinton and Attorney Gen'l Reno wouldn't have been
	able to have told such heroic stories about how they
	""protected"" the rest of us from a group of people who
	kept to themselves, miles out in the prairie.

The BATF needs more people, better weapons and more armored
transports. When they meet hostile fire they should be able to use
more force instead of retreating to a stand off. If you are going to
do a job then do it right. The BATF is there to protect us and they
must have the proper equipment and people to do the job.

	The BATF needs to be disbanded.  This out of control group
	of Rambo wannabees is a danger to the Republic.

With the WoD and the increased crime in the streets the BATF is needed
more now then ever. If they blast away a few good fokes then that is
the price we all have to pay for law and order in this country.

	Well, I figure you're going to get flamed pretty badly by
	everybody else for this incredibly stupid statement, so I'll
	just let it pass for now.

	Case Western reserve, huh?  Do the Feds know about that big 
	stockpile of automatic weapons and crack you have in  your
	house?  Are you the same Daniel Oldham that lives on Orchard
	Drive?  Just so they get the address right, that is...

Look
at all the good people that died in wars to protect this great country
of ours.

	Well, it used to be a great country.  Now I'm not so sure.  
	I knew a few of those good people who died in wars;  I was
	in Viet Nam.  I can assure you, none of us fought to protect
	the right of the government to attack its own citizens with
	military force without provocation.  (Hint: serving a search warrant
	is NOT sufficient provocation to stage a military style assault
	on a religious group.  At Least not here in the US.  Maybe in
	Iraq, or Syria...)

mega fire power. They could of gone in there blasting and killed a few

Yeah, and it's also true most long complicated sequences of events,
calculations, or big computer programs in general.  I don't argue
that you can get similar and maybe useful results from fractals, I
just question whether you >should<.

The fractal fiends seem to be saying that any part of a system that we
can't model should be replaced with a random number generator.  That
has been useful, for instance, in making data more palatable to human
perception or for torture testing the rest of the system, but I don't
think it has much to do with fractals, and I certainly would rather
that the model be improved in a more explicable manner.

I guess I just haven't seen all these earth-shaking fractal models
that explain and correlate to the universe as it actually exists.  I
really hope I do, but I'm not holding my self-similar breath.


Uh huh.  I'll believe it when I see it.  I've been chasing fractal
compression for a few years, and I still don't believe in it.  If it's so
great, how come we don't see it competing with JPEG?  'Cause it can't,
I'll wager.

Actually, I have wagered, I quit trying to make fractal compression
work- and I was trying- because I don't think it's a reasonable
alternative to other techniques.  It is neat, though. :-)

I'll reiterate my disbelief that everything is fractal.  That's why I
don't think fractal compression as it is widely explained is
practical.  I know Barnsley and Sloan have some tricks up their
sleeves that make their demos work, but I don't see anyone using it in a
real product.  It's been six years since Iterated Systems was formed,
right?

	""There are always going to be questions until there's a product
	out there,"" Sloan replies.  The company plans to ship its first
	encoding devices in the summer, he says.  In March, Iterated
	Systems will have the other half of the system: the decoders.

Please, PAY ATTENTION.
I, and others, were referring to TOTAL HOMICIDE DEATHS, NOT JUST
HANDGUN HOMICIDES.  In terms of how likely are you to be killed,
(regardless of how it's done, 'cause DEAD is DEAD), the UK has a
higher homicide rate. Period.  You are more likely to be killed in the
UK than in Switzerland.  If you were to be murdered with a handgun,
then yes, Switzerland has a higher rate.  But, to belabor the point,
you are MORE LIKELY to be murdered in the UK. In that sense, the
weapon is irrelevant.  The UK is more violent, period.

Former Secretary of Education William Bennet, a Roman Catholic, stood
beside the Christian Coalition's spokesman Ralph Reed at a March 3
conference in Washington.  The purpose of the conference was to
publish results of a Christian Coalition poll which was designed
to prove that the Republican party would lose major support if it
backed away from the ""Family Values"" positons of the '92 convention.

Conservative Catholics have swung behind Robertson's organization
with political expertise, legal assistance and high tech communications
support.

The Catholic Campaign for  American, designed as a Catholic version
of the Moral Majority, was founded by Marlene Elwell and Tom Wykes.
Ms. Elwell has been with Robertson since the days of his Freedom
Council in 1985 and worked for him in his presidential bid in 1988.

Ms. Elwell was hired by Domino's Pizza magnate, Tom Monaghan, in 1989
to manage Legatus, a ""nonpolitical"", Catholic businessmen's group.
Membership is limited to Catholics who head corporations with a least $4
million in annual revenues.  Relying on a network of wealthy contacts
at Legatus, Elwell and Wykes had little trouble forming and funding the
Catholic Campaign.

The Campaign's list of national committee members includes U.S. Rep.
Robert K. Dornan, Phyllis Schlafly of the Eagle Forum, the lovely
Pat Buchanan and Rev. Richard J. Neuhaus.   Also on the national
committee is Keith Fournier, a Catholic who heads Pat Robertson's
American Center for Law and Justice.  Another Catholic, Thomas
Patrick Monaghan, senior counsel of Robertson's ACLJ, is also an
active supporter of the Catholic Campaign.

The board of directors includes Frank Shakespeare, broadcasting exec
and former U.S. ambassador to the Pope, Wall Street executive Frank
Lynch, former Reagan official Richard V. Allen, Bishop Rene Gracida
of Corpus Christi and Mary Ellen Bork, wife of unsuccessful Supreme
Court nominee Robert Bork.

I think the point is being missed - that it is apparantly acceptable for
Big Government (Big Brother?) to use TANKS to control the people, as
long as they don't use the BIG GUN (but everything else is allright...).

Tanks deployed against civilians, let alone FIRING on them with crew
served weaponry (a .50 Heavy Machine Gun is crew-served) is something
both our press and government howl about instantly when done in some
other country.  Against civilians that have, at most, one-shot-at-a-time
LIGHT small arms.  Certainly nothing that places the people in or behind
the tank in any real danger.  Molotov coctails?  A round from a rifle
or pistol deals with anybody approaching with one of those.  And ""snipers""
too often turn out to be strays from other cops/guard/army gunfire.

I don't know about the other people in this group (or on the net) but
the idea of tanks being used to control civilians, in anything that
pretends to be a free society is outrageous.  When Big Government feels
it is necessary to use that kind of force to stomp out protests (even
violent) of the citizens, that suggests that the government is totally
out of control, since that is effectively the government declaring war
on its own people.  If the government was living up to its responsibility,
government of the people BY THE PEOPLE, not the 'lords' and other elites
who want to keep their good thing going, the citizens wouldn't feel the
need to be resorting to acts that need to be squashed with a military
boot.  People do things like that because they have become convinced
that it is the only option that remains, other attempts to have grievances
redressed have been ignored.  And yes, there is a criminal element that
will exploit this, but the fact remains that the government has been
unresponsive or such acts wouldn't be apt to happen.  Still not an excuse
to open up on civilians with tanks, heavy machine guns, or whatever.
Its the old 'might makes right' philosophy that is the hallmark of a
government going rogue:  They don't like it? Tough. We will simply
squash them under an iron boot.  Actually addressing their grievances
in other than token fashion with huge volumes of hot air is just too
inconvenient...  Sort of a variation on mushroom management:  Keep them
in the dark, Smother them with shit, and Crush them when ready...

And these are the folks that many liberals are trying to arrange things
so that they will have a MONOPOLY on coercive force (firearms that are
than expensive toys...) by gutting the Bill of Rights (cuz it just isn't
PROGRESSIVE or doesn't fit in with MODERN THINKING anymore)...

Unbelievable.

And I do believe amid the smoke, confusion, etc of a real riot situation,
that it would be POSSIBLE for a tank to get away with firing the main gun
into a building at close range?  One would hear an explosion among many
explosions.  It is loud, but it is not going to stand out like a 1000
pound bomb or a tactical nuke.  There would be a hole blown in the wall,
and some rubble, but with tanks knocking over walls, and other sources
of buildings turning into rubble, and other covering racket such as
gunfire, including 50's tacking away, it would not stand out that much,
and could be explained by ""musta been a gas leak... "".  I think it could be
done and not be reported under such conditions - it is POSSIBLE.  It is
not like a tank driving down a quiet street on a Sunday afternoon, turning
and firing, you know.  THAT would stand out, and be pretty impossible
to cover up.

I've already corrected my mistake earlier in this thread.  I saw a brief 
news report which led to the above inaccuracy.  I have since seen detailed 
summaries that show the tanks returned in the late morning.

Experiment.  There was some difficulty locking up to the data frames,
and engineers are presently checking whether the problem was in
equipment at the tracking station.

3.  Magellan has completed 7277 orbits of Venus and is now 32 days
from the end of Cycle 4 and the start of the Transition Experiment.

it would have some miniscule impact, it would be only for a short time
as it goes zipping across the sky.


No doubt.  People are always looking for something to protest about, so

Rather, people kill people with guns.  The sad truth is: sometimes that is
good, or at least, better than the alternative.


Ok.  There are about 1400 fatal firearm accidents per year [1], and the
number has been in decline since early this century [2].  Most of these
accidents involve rifles or shot guns, not handguns.

...

In fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that. 
The idea that my Ruger Mark II Bull Barrel (a semi-auto 0.22 caliber
handgun) was designed to kill or hurt people, even for self defense,
would, I'm sure, come as a surprise to its designer.  It certainly isn't
why I have it.  It certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it,
and might even kill them, but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to
kill people.


In fact, that is what happens most of the time.  Most self defensive uses
of firearms don't involve firing any shots.  Most criminals would prefer
not to be shot, and will go to some effort not to be, including doing what
you say when you point a gun at them.

If you were called on to design a tool, that could be easily carried, to
immediately stop someone attacking you, what would it be?  A handgun is
about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work
the best.[3]


Certainly, no one argues that handguns (of the type we are discussing)
aren't deadly weapons.  However, it simply isn't true to say that all of
them were designed to kill people.  Moreover, what exactly is wrong with
having deadly weapons?  There are times when it is perfectly legitimate to
use deadly force, e.g. in self defense.  I consider it not just my right,
but my duty to defend myself and my family, and that includes having and
knowing how to use the tools to do that.

""The strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear
arms is, as a last resort, to protect themselves against tyranny in
government.""
	- T. Jefferson.

I think what Jefferson said is still true.


Not very often compared to other use.[3]


This isn't that common either, at least when compared to other uses.  It is
very rare that a non-violent person will suddenly ""get-pissed"" and kill
someone, gun or not.  In most cases, the people who murder have long
histories of violence.  If you have good reason to believe that these
people wouldn't kill if they didn't have a gun, feel free to present it.


Right, but there are times when killing things is called for.  I hope I
never have to shoot a person, but I've had to kill a number of animals from
rodents to cows, and when I do, I don't want them to suffer any more than
is necessary.  I prefer they die instantly, but failing that, I want them
to drop so I can quickly finish them with the next shot, and failing that,
I don't want them to go fast or far.  I try to choose the best weapon and
ammunition I have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal I'm
after, but it doesn't always work as I plan.  Without belaboring the point,
people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns,
particularly handguns, haven't used them much for that purpose.

[2] RKBA.002 - Declining trend of accidental deaths by firearms
           Version 1.1 (last changed on 90/04/23 at 22:28:19)

DESCRIPTION
===========
The accidental deaths by firearm per capita has been declining steadily 
for almost sixty years. In 1932, the accidental deaths by firearm per 
1,000,000 people was 24.03. In 1987, it was 5.74. The decline has been 
steady, consistent, and a fairly straight line when plotted. At the rate 
of the last sixty years, it will reach zero sometime around 2025 AD.

CONCLUSION
==========
Firearms have been a declining factor in accidental deaths for over 
sixty years, despite rising per-capita gun ownership.

So, you have the right unless the Federal Government says you don't.
I don't think I like this very much.

This would be much better if it said ""everyone except those who have
been striped of this right by due process of law"" or some such thing.

Also, I don't care for the Federal Government stepping on states rights
regardless of which state right is being stepped on.  If the constitution
doesn't give the Feds some power then they have to just shut up about
it.

The only way the Feds should have anything to say is if the Constitution
prohibits localities from infringing on the RKBA.  In which case this
bill should just reiterate that the RKBA is guaranteed by the Constitution
and that the Feds will take appropriate action if it is infringed.

Yup, you said it.  I admire such honesty. ;-)


Fire an Anschutz .22, then come back and talk to us.  You're letting
ignorance and possibly fear cloud your thinking.  Either that, or this
is sour grapes because we beat you in the Olympic shooting events.
Funny, you'd think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse. ;-)


Precisely.  That makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry.
Not everybody has the time to train with a gladius, you know, but for
some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time.  To
extend this a bit further, you need only a certain level of competence
to beat another with a range weapon.  Getting in their face with a
weapon and winning is much more difficult, and requires more training
time the average citizen just does not have.  I've spent a few years
practicing with a sword.  I can take the common person armed with one
(though self-defense isn't the reason I own one).  My kid sister would
have an even chance of beating me, gun vs. gun, with only a month of
training.  That makes firearms much better, in our eyes.


Excellent point.  Perhaps you aren't so naive after all?


Taken into consideration in what respect?  Though quite wrong, let's
make it a blanket statement for weapons in general.  This has been
taken into consideration.  We call use of them aggrivated assault,
assault with a deadly weapon, assault with intent to kill, attempted
murder, and a whole host of others, and tack on extra prison time.


In Norway I suspect it was about the only weapon available.  You conquered
your land (among others) a full millenia before we were thought of, and
shortly thereafter weapons weren't quite so common.  I suspect that a few
world wars made a difference too, since in times of emergency weapons
tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes.  I'm curious, though,
were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime, or
were they aquired by other means?  Any requirements other than just
registering the shotgun?


""Come on down to honest Erik's Used Swords!  Here's a slightly-used
short sword, *THE* battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh
century!  Only $39.95 with trade-in.  Easy financing!""  Sorry, I
couldn't resist.  You guys still slicing each other with long knives,
or is this really not a problem?


I'm all for that.  What gets me is that scandanavians (and yes, I'm only
a couple generations off the longship) used to be some of the most
feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago, yet now seem to
spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing.
Maybe you had a bit more time, and a more homogeneous culture, to become
civilized with?


Yes.  We're too damned violent, partially I believe because we are not
a homogeneous culture and don't identify ourselves as ""Americans"" first
and foremost.  I'm rather proud of my Norwegian and Danish heritage,
whereas I suspect you couldn't care less about that 2% Welsh blood in
your veins thanks to a raid in Ireland back in 1055?  The time scale
and the homogeneous culture are important.  Equally important is a
basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good.
In America, the individual is more important than the masses.  Personal
liberties are prized above all.  This is, sadly, changing of late, but
I trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict
individuals for little collective benefit hateful to Americans.  I'd
hazard a guess that, were America less interested in freedom and
personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would
have sent our armed forces anywhere.  One poor effect of this culture
we have is that we're looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy
to identify with only a small segment of the population.  My grandmother
tells of being discriminated against back in Denmark because she spoke
""low Dane,"" whereas others spoke ""high Dane.""  It was shortly after
World War II, as I remember, that ""low Dane"" was abolished so there was
one common dialect.  We cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem,
because we have even more obvious means of identifying an ""outsider.""

Thankfully, it is true that the majority go through life without

are the most effective means of self protection.  What other means do
you propose as equally effective?



New to this country? New to political theory?
Alas, I was speaking of principle.  Without principle, all attempts at
republican forms of gov't are futile.  There are times when public and
political opinion are contrary to principle, which is why we have a
Constitution which enumerates gov't powers and presumes certain
rights.  A major reason for this was to prevent a tyranny of the
majority.


This is exactly why law should be based on reasoned thought, not
immediate perception.  Of course, it doesn't always work that way.
Fortunately, while there are no guarantees, logic sometimes does
prevail.  And, if not, there are still means for correction.  
As far as ""enough active voters"" are concerned, that is still
an open question until the vote is made.

Ah, clarification by obfuscation.

Actually, the words ""A well regulated Milita, being necessary to the
security of a free state"" is a present participle, used as an
adjective to modify 'militia', which is followed by the main clause of
the sentence, the subject being 'the right', the verb 'shall'.  It
asserts that the right to keep and bear arms is essential for
maintaining a milita.  The sentence doesn't restrict the right, or
state or imply possession of the right by anyone or anything other
than the people.  All it does is make a positive statement regarding a
right of the people. The PEOPLE, as in you and me, as in the First,
Fourth, Ninth, Tenth, as well as the Second amendment.
The existence of this right is assumed - it is not granted by the
amendment. There is no stated or implied condition relating the right
to bear arms to the necessity of a well-regulated militia to the security of
a free state.
In other words, the entire sentence says that the right to keep and
bear arms is UNCONDITIONAL.



The final word on liberties and rights should not belong ""to the
many"".  That is why we have a Constitution.  Otherwise, a tyrrany of
the majority can ensue from ""popular"" opinion, a concept which you
should be familiar with from the Federalist papers.",politics

(3)  But the lack of evidence for X does not constitute evidence for the

Geez, Dal must have slipped something into Ted's drink sometime.  Comparing
Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable.  Prince has never hit well in
the minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter
in the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have
another brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville 
before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up
in the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the 
majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he 
became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation 
as an outstanding defensive catcher.  It's not clear he ever learned to
hit.  His four years with more than 100 AB--

Born 31 July 1962
Year     AB      BA     SLG     OBA  
1988    195    .282    .320    .328
1990    220    .277    .373    .321
1991    459    .264    .351    .317
1992    485    .249    .359    .290 

No power, less-than-league-average walks, peak year when he turned 28, 
now declining.  If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince,
given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it's not
a rosy picture.

BTW, I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation 
coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was
a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter
and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter
as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.

"Moscow Scientific Inductrial Association ""Spectrum"" offer
       VIDEOSCAN vision system for PC/AT,wich include software and set of
       controllers.

                     SOFTWARE

            For support VIDEOSCAN family program kit was developed. Kit
       includes more then 200 different functions for image processing.
            Kit works in the interactive regime, and has include Help for
       non professional users.
            There are next possibility:
       - input frame by any board of VIDEOSCAN family;
       - read - white image to - from disk;
       - print image on the printer;
       - makes arithmetic with 2 frames;
       - filter image;
       - work with gistogramme;
       - edit image.
       - include users exe modules.

                     CONTROLLER VS9

       The function of VS-9 controller is to load TV-images into  PC/AT.
       VS-9 controller allows one to load a fragment of the TV-frame from
       a field of 724x600 pixels.
       The clock rate is 14,7 MHz when loading an image with 512 pixel in
       the line and 7,4 MHz when loading a 256 pixels image. This
       provides the equal pixel size of input image in both horizontal
       and vertical directions.
       The number of gray levels in any input modes is 256.
       Video signal capture time - 2.5s.

                     CONTROLLER VS52

       The purpose of the controller is to enter the TV images into a IBM
       PC AT or any other machine of that type. The controller was
       created on the base of modern elements, including user
       programmable gate arrays.
       The controller allows to digitize a input signal with different
       resolutions. Its flexible architecture makes possible to change
       technical parameters. Instead of TV signal one can process any
       other analog signal (including signals from slow-speed scanning
       devices).
       The controller has the following technical characteristics:
       - memory volume - from 256 K to 2 Mb ;
       - resolution when working with standard video signal - from 64x64
       to 1024x512 pixels ;
       - resolution when working in slow input regime - up to 2048x1024
       pixels;
       - video signal capture time - 40 ms.
       - maximum size of a screen when memory volume is 2Mb - 2048x1024
       pixels ;
       - number of gray level - 256 ;
       - clock rate for input - up to 30 MHz ;
       - 4 input video multiplexer ;
       - input/output lookup table (LUT);
       - possibility to realize ""scroll"" and ""zoom"";













       - 8 lines for external synchronization (an input using external
       controlling signal) ;
       - electronic adjustment of black and white reference for analog -
       digital converter;
       - possibility output image to the color RGB monitor.
       One can change all listed above functions and parameters of the
       controller by reprogramming it.

First of all as far as I know, only male homosexuality is explicitly
mentioned in the bibles, so you're off the hook there, I think. In
any event, there are *plenty* of people in many denominations who
do not consider a person's sexual identification of gay/lesbian/bisexual
as an ""immoral lifestyle choice""


This is another misconception. You are not being told the whole story.

My former minister is a lesbian, and I know personally and
professionally several openly gay and lesbian ministers. I am
a Unitarian-Universalist and like most others in my denomination,
am pro-choice. You needn't go looking to the Unitarian Universalists
(which is a liberal religion) for acceptance of your sexual
identification and pro-choice views, however; there are many of us
who believe in spirituality AND freedom of conscience.

Good Luck on your journey!

The problem with Commercial Titan is that MM has made little or no attempt
to market it.  They're basically happy with their government business and
don't want to have to learn how to sell commercially.

A secondary problem is that it is a bit big.  They'd need to go after
multi-satellite launches, a la Ariane, and that complicates the marketing
task quite significantly.

They also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong time
to get them started properly.  If memory serves, the pad used for the Mars
Observer launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that had
prevented launches from it for a year or so.

There have been a few CT launches.  Mars Observer was one of them.  So

	not
		innocent until presumed guilty.

	1)  Where are the video tapes from the tanks?  ALL of them.

		Don't tell me they do not exist.  They are standard
		equipment.

	2)  So you think Koresh fired the place, because of the explosion?

		a)  Tear gas comes with an aerosol to spread it.  This
		  aerosol is DELIBERATELY made to be as non-flammable
		  as possible.  It is as non-flammable as possible.

			.... gotcha!

		  ... when in isolation from other substances.

		  WHy was a pipe deliveryu system used rather than remote
		  launchers?  WHy did the FBI not announce ""this window,
		  blown in plus tear gas, five minutes; then the wall come
		  down"", and maintain a left to right sequence?

		b)  Most aerosols also have a secondary compound, that when
		  mixed in, becomes a VERY flammable (and difficult to trace)
		  suspension, with a VERY special property:  exposure to
		  brief eruptions of high heat (muzzle blasts) or long
		  exposure to low heat (matches, a stove) will NOT tend
		  to ignite.

			What other chemicals come up in the forensics?
			Who else will be allowed to test the site?

		c)  After a few minutes to hours (ifdesired, the combnation
		  rate can be controlled as desired), the mixture can be made
		  to become veryignitable onb exposure to a temperature
		  above a certain point (a tracer round) for a certain
		  heat quantity (a small explosive charge) or for a length
		  of time (start a wall fire and wait).

			Check your military records; look at the tapes.
			Why were tanks (large capacity delivey systems),
			tear gas (why not somnorifics?), and now (why
			the hurry. was there still a comm channel open
			to the outside?).

			Do you see any trace of fire coming BACK to the
			compound in the videos?  ALL the videos?  Which ones
			are missing?

	Do I sound paranoid?  Maybe.  Am I? Probably not.
	You trust the FBI and BATF  to render judgement?
		IN advance of a Court?  God help us.
			(For we are surely not helping ourselves).
	You trut the Federal Gevernment to give us a clean slate?

		You are 4.3 trillion (admitted!) down and counting.
		Look again.

	Did it happen that way?  I do not know.  I was not there.
		AND IT SHOULD WAIT FOR A COURT TO DECIDE.
	But will that happen?  89 people will NOT have the chance
		to tell their side as the BATF leader was, on camera.

No one wins.  Except:  more force next time.

	Listen to your hearts, people.

So, your opinion is truth.  I see...  :-)


You can believe that if you wish.  It is undeniable, however, that people

And since their leader was preaching that they would have an apocalypse, you 
can not say undeniably that there wouldn't have been a mass suicide if the 
FBI had simply stayed outside and waited another 51 days.


I am the heartless bleeding heart?  You are not making sense.
You seem to have no concern that someone would keep children inside this 
compound when they had 51 days to let them out.  That sounds pretty heartless 
to me.

I just heard on the news that some of the survivors regret they hadn't 
stayed in the inferno to prove their loyalty to Koresh.  This makes me

Have you ever heard of Jonestown?
The sad thing is the people inside the compound were the authority 
worshipers and their only authority was Koresh/Howell.   If these 
people were able to think for themselves, there would likely be a lot 
more survivors today.  Koresh preached a fiery apocalypse as early as 
last year.


By all means, the FBI should be investigated, too.

  There was an interesting article in Scientific American some time ago
about breathing liquid. (It was a few months before _The Abyss_ came out.)
As far as I can remember, they mentioned three things that were difficult
to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid:
  - low viscosity --- if it's too difficult to force the fluid in & out 
    of the lungs, you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own
    breathing effort (let alone anything else)

  - diffusion rate --- obviously, not all the air in your lungs is
    expelled when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expelled
    is the part that's nearest the walls of the alveoli. (alveolus?)
    So the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done
    by diffusion of the gas through the fluid. Apparently oxygen
    tends to diffuse more readily than CO2, so even if you can get enough
    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.

  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough
    gas per unit volume. 

  Oh, and of course, your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs
or interfere with their healing or anything like that...

     This paper reports the optical tracking results of EGS
(experimental geodetic satellite) which was launched on August 13,
1986, by NASDA. The EGS optical tracking experiment process and an
outline of the Radio Research Laboratory (RRL) optical ground       <----
station are discussed. A star tracking technique for optical
equipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit
prediction improvement are also described. The accuracy of EGS
tracking data obtained by RRL at the request of NASDA is also
discussed. In addition, it is briefly demonstrated that the
position of the Japanese amateur satellite (JAS-1) which was
launched with the EGS, was accurately determined by means of a      <----
satellite tracking video. It is clear from this experiment that     <----
optical observation data (i.e., satellite direction data) are very  <----
useful for satellite orbit determination during initial launch      <----
stages. Furthermore, the results confirm the effectivenes of these  <----
two satellite optical tracking techniques.                          <----


MU radar measurements of orbital debris

     Distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross 
section are determined from a series of observations made with a high-
power VHF Doppler radar (MU radar) of Japan. An automated data 
processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of 
orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail 
echoes or lightning atmospherics. Although the results are preliminary, 
they showed good agreement with those from NORAD tracking radar      <----
observations using a much higher frequency. It is found that the     <----
collision frequency of a Space Station of 1 km x 1 km size at an 
altitude of 500 km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as 
once per two years. 


Monitoring of the MU radar antenna pattern by Satellite Ohzora (EXOS-C)

Publication Date: Jun. 1986
      As the first attempt among MST (mesosphere stratosphere 
troposphere) type radars, the MU (middle and upper atmosphere) radar 
features an active phased array system. Unlike the conventional large 
VHF radars, in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed 
to individual antenna elements, each of 475 solid state power amplifier 
feeds each antenna element. This system configuration enables very fast 
beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the 
antenna into independent subarrays, because phase shift and signal 
division/combination are performed at a low signal level using 
electronic devices under control of a computer network. The antenna 
beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the 
zenith angle of 30 deg. Since a precise phase alignment of each element 
is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system, careful 
calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna 
element was carried out. Among various aircraft which may be used for 
this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to 
make a long term monitoring with the same system. An antenna pattern 
monitoring system for the MU radar was developed using the scientific 
satellite OHZORA (EXOS-C). A receiver named MUM (MU radar antenna 
Monitor) on board the satellite measures a CW signal of 100 to 400 
watts transmitted from the MU radar. The principle of the measurement 
and results are discussed.

Assuming you're serious, I guess you'd be surprised to hear
that us GUYS don't think so. I would guess that a tiny fraction
of 1% of the folks reading your post agree with it. I kind of
doubt that even you agree with it.

I'm not going to go through your points one at a time, because, 
after all, not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball.

I'm only replying to this because you brought up Pam Postema, the
AAA umpire who sued (is suing?) baseball on the grounds of sex
discrimination because she wasn't promoted to the majors.


I've never seen her ump a game. I have no first hand experience
with her ability as an umpire.

But I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be
that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the
umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems
to me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees
the role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn't promote her
either.

The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners
safe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is
to maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the
players from trying to kill each other. 

Umpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most
of us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she
deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of
the rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires
need to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.

"In regards to fractal commpression, I have seen 2 fractal compressed ""movies"".
They were both fairly impressive.  The first one was a 64 gray scale ""movie"" of
Casablanca, it was 1.3MB and had 11 minutes of 13 fps video.  It was a little
grainy but not bad at all.  The second one I saw was only 3 minutes but it
had 8 bit color with 10fps and measured in at 1.2MB.

I consider the fractal movies a practical thing to explore.  But unlike many 
other formats out there, you do end up losing resolution.  I don't know what
kind of software/hardware was used for creating the ""movies"" I saw but the guy
that showed them to me said it took 5-15 minutes per frame to generate.  But as
I said above playback was 10 or more frames per second.  And how else could you
put 11 minutes on one floppy disk?",graphics

"Note: These trial updates are summarized from reports in the
_Idaho Statesman_ and the local NBC affiliate television
station, KTVB Channel 7.

Randy Weaver/Kevin Harris trial update: Day 5.

Monday, April 19, 1993 was the fifth day of the trial.

Synopsis: Government informant Kenneth Fadeley testified that
Randy Weaver sold him two shotguns in violation of the National
Firearms Act of 1934.  U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge
asks jurors not to hear accounts of the Waco fire because
of possible influences on the Weaver/Harris case.

The testimony of FBI Special Agent Greg Rampton apparently
ended without further incident, as it was mentioned neither
by KTVB nor the _Idaho Statesman_.

The day was highlighted by the testimony of Kenneth Fadeley,
who had been posing as an outlaw biker and illegal guns person
named Gus Magiosono.  Fadeley testified that he was acting as
an informant for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms
in his dealings with Randy Weaver.

Fadeley began by stating that he had met Weaver in 1987 at an
Aryan Nations summer conference in Hayden Lake, Idaho.  The two
then met again October 11, 1989 (note the huge separation in
time) at a restaurant in Sandpoint, Idaho, to begin a weapons
transaction.  He stated that Weaver had said, ""He felt like he
(Weaver) was being prepared to do something dangerous for the
White cause.""

The two later met October 24, 1989 behind the restaurant and
later went to a city park to make the sale.  During this second
meeting, Fadeley was wearing a small recording device to
tape the conversation.  Weaver allegedly showed him an H&R 12-
gauge shotgun with a 13-inch barrel and an overall length of
19.25 inches.  He additionally showed a Remington 12-gauge
shotgun with a 12.75-inch barrel and an overall length of
24.5 inches (NFA requires minimums of 18 inches for barrel
length and an overall length of 26 inches).  On tape, Weaver
is reported to have said that he could perform better work once
his machine shop is set up.  The two then discuss the possibility
of future sales.  Fadeley then counts out three hundred dollars
for the two guns and promises the balance of one-hundred fifty
dollars when they next meet.  (Note that the ATF could have
simply arrested him here.  Why did they wait until January 1991 -
over a year later - to arrest him?  This is not explained).

The next meeting took place on Nov 30, 1989.  Fadeley stated that
his ""source"" had only come up with one hundred dollars instead
of the one-hundred fifty he'd promised.  At this point, Weaver
suspected he was dealing with an informant, ""I had a guy in
Spokane tell me you were bad.""  Fadeley managed to convince
Weaver otherwise.

The _Idaho Statesman_ states explicitly that three tapes were
made of conversations with Randy Weaver.  Thus, each of these
meetings must have been recorded.  However, the _Statesman_ also
reported that a tape of a telephone conversation involving Vicki
Weaver (Randy Weaver's wife) was played to the court.  There must
have also been phone taps.

These tapes were played to the court via both headphones and
loudspeakers under the objections of Gerry Spence, Weaver's
attorney.  Spence said to a KTVB reporter that he wanted to
make sure that the government proved its case, ""...if it has a
case at all..."" according to the rules.

Randy Weaver tore off his headphones and wept when he heard his
wife's voice on the tape.

U.S. District Court Judge Edward Lodge asked jurors not to hear
accounts of the Waco fire because of possible influences on the
Weaver/Harris case.  Exactly how such information could affect
this trial is not explained.

Other notes: Sunday evening there was a report on KTVB concerning
Kevin Harris.  Unnamed agents within the FBI admit that they are
surprised that Kevin Harris is still alive.  First, they were
surprised that he survived the initial gunshot wound(s) sustained
in the initial firefight at the Y-junction.  Later, when Randy
Weaver was struck by sniper fire the sniper had reported that
Harris had been struck (not Weaver).  Finally, there was a report
that the FBI agent who killed Vicki Weaver believed he was aiming
at Kevin Harris instead.  (This is what was reported).  Critics
are charging that the FBI was blatantly trying to eliminate the
only non-government witness to the deaths of Samuel Weaver and
Deputy Marshal William Degan.  Some local people believe that
Harris's survival is simply due to divine intervention.",politics

You totally forgot the original post that you posted Allen. In that post
you stated that the ""wrap"" was on top of and in addition to any overhead.
Geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true.


Come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing
what and who is working on integration. This is simply an ad hominum
attack and you know it.


Of course there is a fee. It is for administration. Geez Allen any
organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in  legitimate
costs, such as libraries and other things that must be there to support
a program and ""wrap"" as you originally stated it.You stated that wrap
was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you
say is not true. Which is it Allen?


As you have posted on this subject Allen, you state that wrap is over and
above overhead and is a seperate charge. You admit here that this is wrong.
Nasa has a line item budget every year. I have seen it Allen. Get some
numbers from that detailed NASA budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then
howl to high heaven about it. Until you do that you are barking in the wind.


Integration could be done better at the centers. Apollo integration was 
done here at Msfc and that did not turn out so bad. The philosophy of
Reston is totally wrong Allen. There you have a bunch of people who are
completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee. There
is no way that will ever work. It has never worked in any large scale project
that it was ever tried on. Could you imagine a Reston like set up for 
Apollo?


Oh you are full of it Allen on this one. I agree that JSC screwed up big.
They should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it
replaced. To make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your
bias goes. Come to MSFC for a couple of weeks and you will find out just
how wrong you really are. Maybe not, people like you believe exactly what
they want to believe no matter  what the facts are contrary to it. 


I agree that integration is the single most important part of a  successful
large scale effort. What I completly disagree with is seperating that
integration function from  the people that are doing the work. It is called
leadership Allen. That is what made Apollo work. Final responsibility for
the success of Apollo was held by less than 50 people. That is leadership
and responsibility. There is neither when you have any organization set up
as Reston is. You could take the same people and move them to JSC or MSFC
and they could do a much better job. Why did it take a year for Reston to
finally say something about the problem? If they were on site and part of the
process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place.

There is one heck of a lot I do not know Allen, but one thing I do know is that
for a project to be successful you must have leadership. I remember all of the
turn over at Reston that kept SSF program in shambles for years do you? It is
lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem. Lack of
leadership from the White House, Congress and at Reston. Nasa is only a
symptom of a greater national problem. You are so narrowly focused in your
efforts that you do not see this.


No, I am saying that if they were located at JSC it never would have 
happened in the first place.

I have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is
at reston was on site at JSC the problem never would have happened, totally
ignoring the lack of leadership of congress. This many headed hydra that
has grown up at NASA is the true problem of the Agency and to try to 
change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of
your position.",space

You're right about the signal being strong. I live in West Philadelphia,
and I can get FAN almost perfectly. It's a sports fans dream (especially
if that person is from NY and wants to hear about his teams while he's
away at school). As for Lupica & Berman, it's turned out to be Lupica,
then Berman. Neither of them wanted to work a full four hour show, so Ed
Coleman and Dave Sims' old four-hour slot was broken down into two
seperate two-hour show - Lupica from 10-12, and Berman from 12-2. And they
both happen to suck in comparison to Eddie and Dave.  COME BACK, GUYS!


Like I said, I live in Philly, so I can hear FAN and/or WIP whenever I
want. But I cannot stand WIP. And it isn't because I loathe the Philly
sports teams - the Phillies are my favorite NL team (Yanks are favorite
AL), and the Eagles aren't too bad either. There are two big problems:

	1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike
	  the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an
	  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem
 	  to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on
	  Broad Street. Also, FANs periodic sports updates (every 20
	  minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the
	  country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score
	  being reported on WIP.

	2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss
	  from his days at FAN, none of the hosts really seems to have
	  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.
	  The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely
	  on the basis that he used to play for the Eagles.

Anyway, that's my two cents on the whole FAN vs WIP battle.",sport

   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE           Contact:  OASIS (310) 364-2290

   15 April 1993                                Los Angeles, CA

     LOCAL NATIONAL SPACE SOCIETY CHAPTERS SPONSOR TALK BY L.A.
  ADVOCATE OF LUNAR POWER SYSTEM AS ENERGY SOURCE FOR THE WORLD

   On April 21, the OASIS and Ventura County chapters of the National 
Space Society will sponsor a talk by Lunar Power System (LPS) co-
inventor and vice-president of the LPS Coalition, Dr. Robert D.
Waldron.  It will be held at 7:30 p.m. at the Rockwell Science
Center in Thousand Oaks, CA.

   Dr. Waldron is currently a Technical Specialist in Space
Materials Processing with the Space Systems Division of Rockwell
International in Downey, California.  He is a recognized world
authority on lunar materials refinement.  He has written or
coauthored more than 15 articles or reports on nonterrestrial
materials processing or utilization.  Along with Dr. David
Criswell, Waldron invented the lunar/solar power system concept.

   Momentum is building for a coalition of entrepreneurs, legal
experts, and Soviet and U.S. scientists and engineers to build
the Lunar Power System, a pollution-free, energy source with a
potential to power the globe.

   For the past three years members of the coalition, nearly half
from California, have rejuvenated the commercial and scientific
concept of a solar power system based on the Moon.

   The LPS concept entails collecting solar energy on the lunar
surface and beaming the power to Earth as microwaves transmitted
through orbiting antennae.  A mature LPS offers an enormous
source of clean, sustainable power to meet the Earth's ever
increasing demand using proven, basic technology.

   OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Space
Industrialization) is the Greater Los Angeles chapter of the
National Space Society, which is an international non-profit
organization that promotes development of the space frontier.
The Ventura County chapter is based in Oxnard, CA.

"For those missing the context of this thrilling discussion between
Jim and I, Jim wrote the following to me in e-mail after I pointed out
that he (Jim) had taken a quote out of context:

He directed a similar accusation of hypocrisy, again based on a lack of
response to an article by Robert Weiss, toward Stephen.

I pointed out that I did, in fact, agree that both Robert Weiss and
Jim Meritt took quotes out of context.  Hence, I find it difficult to
understand why Jim thinks I am a hypocrite.  Needless to say, I don't
have time to reply to *every* article on t.r.m. that takes a quote
out of context.  

I asked Jim the following:

Jim replied by saying 

But today we find four articles from Jim, one of which has the subject
""Silence is concurrence"":  


Which is, of course, a complete red herring.  Taking quotes out of
context isn't a crime.  I don't have time to read every article on
t.r.m., and I'm certainly under no obligation to reply to them all.

Does ""silence is concurrence"" imply that Jim thinks that because I
didn't respond to Weiss' articles I must condone Weiss' taking quotes
out of context?  Jim doesn't want to give a direct answer to this
question; read what he has written and decide for yourself.


But back to the context of my conversation with Jim.  Jim's next 
gambit was to claim that he was using inductive logic when he
concluded that I was being a hypocrite.  I challenged him to provide
the details of that logic that led him to an incorrect conclusion.
Today we find another obscure article (posting it twice didn't help
make it more clear, Jim), titled ""Inductive Logic"":


More red herrings.  Could Jim mean that he has read an uncountably large
number of my articles?  Could Jim mean that because I ""axed"" his articles,
but not Weiss' articles, he wants to conclude inductively ...
Well, I can't see where he is going with this.

But I can help him with his induction.  I've written roughly 80
articles since January.  The vast majority of them are discussions with
Frank DeCenso and other inerrantists, where I take the position that
they are making bad arguments.  Some are discussions with Jim Meritt
where I take the position that he is making bad arguments (a straw man
argument earlier, and taking quotes out of context more recently.)

Think hard about this Jim.  See the pattern?  Think harder.  Run it
through your induction engine and see what pops out.  ",religion

"The observation that the Tree of Life would rotate clockwise in the
northern hemisphere and counterclockwise in the southern probably doesn't
give enough consideration to the feebleness of the Coriolis force compared
to, say, the phototropism of vegetation.  A much more likely explanation
is the classic one: that the clockwise swastika is the Sun-wheel, because
the sun progresses across the sky that way.  (Although that's not the
historical way it happened; clocks were first made as little imitation
images of the sun moving thru the heavens.  So it's more valid to talk of
the clock going sunwise, but do the engineers listen to me?  Of course
not.)  Anyway, there is still much uncertainty about whether the
anti-swastika goes counter-sunwise because that represents Evil, or
because it is the Sun's twin-opposite, the Moonwheel.  The use of anti-Sun
to represent Evil may be because humans are so strongly visually-oriented,
but I'm not going to try to settle THAT one just now.

According to the Defensive Average stats posted by Sherri, Baerga had the
highest percentage of DPs turned in the league, while Alomar had the worst.
However, Alomar had a higher Defensive Average.  So who would be better?

Using Alomar's opportunities (469 groundballs, 73 possible double plays)
Alomar had 332 groundouts and turned 18 DPs.
Baerga would have had (with same DA & DP%) 328 groundouts and 35 DPs.

Using Baerga's opportunites (545 groundballs, 99 possible double plays).
Alomar would have had (with the same DA & DP%) 386 groundouts and 25 DPs.
Baerga had 381 groundouts and 47 DPs.

Baerga looks better, though it's possible his DP% would be lower with a 
different SS.

Will Baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays, however?  Alomar
has established a high level of defense, Baerga has not.  I would bet on
Alomar to be better next year, but last year Baerga was just as good overall.

"From the article ""What's New"" Apr-16-93 in sci.physics.research:

........
WHAT'S NEW (in my opinion), Friday, 16 April 1993  Washington, DC

1. SPACE BILLBOARDS! IS THIS ONE THE ""SPINOFFS"" WE WERE PROMISED?
In 1950, science fiction writer Robert Heinlein published ""The
Man Who Sold the Moon,"" which involved a dispute over the sale of
rights to the Moon for use as billboard. NASA has taken the firsteps toward this
 hideous vision of the future.  Observers were
startled this spring when a NASA launch vehicle arrived at the
pad with ""SCHWARZENEGGER"" painted in huge block letters on the
side of the booster rockets.  Space Marketing Inc. had arranged
for the ad to promote Arnold's latest movie. Now, Space Marketing
is working with University of Colorado and Livermore engineers on
a plan to place a mile-long inflatable billboard in low-earth
orbit.  NASA would provide contractual launch services. However,
since NASA bases its charge on seriously flawed cost estimates
(WN 26 Mar 93) the taxpayers would bear most of the expense. This
may look like environmental vandalism, but Mike Lawson, CEO of
Space Marketing, told us yesterday that the real purpose of the
project is to help the environment! The platform will carry ozone
monitors he explained--advertising is just to help defray costs.
..........

What do you think of this revolting and hideous attempt to vandalize
the night sky? It is not even April 1 anymore.
What about light pollution in observations? (I read somewhere else that
it might even be visible during the day, leave alone at night).
Is NASA really supporting this junk?
Are protesting groups being organized in the States?
Really, really depressed.

"Reading from a Amoco Performance Products data sheet, their
ERL-1906 resin with T40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive
strength of 280,000 psi.  It has a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,
therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column
that can just support itself is 4.8 million inches, or 400,000 ft,
or 75 Statute miles.

Now, a real structure will have horizontal bracing (either a truss
type, or guy wires, or both) and will be used below the crush strength.
Let us assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical 
strength.  This gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant
section column.  

A constant section column is not the limit on how high you can
build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section
as you go up.  For example, let us say you have a 280,000 pound
load to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in
calculation).  This requires 2.5 square inches of column cross
sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure
below the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile 
below the payload, the total load is now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.

The next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cross section
to support the top mile of tower plus the payload.  Each mile
of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way
to the bottom.  We can see from this that there is no theoretical
limit on area, although there will be practical limits based
on how much composites we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how
much load you need to support on the ground (for which you need
a foundation that the bedrock can support.

Let us arbitrarily choose $1 billion as the limit in costruction
cost.  With this we can afford perhaps 10,000,000 lb of composites,
assuming our finished structure costs $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure
is just for materials cost.  Then we have a tower/payload mass
ratio of 35.7:1.  At a 3.3% mass ratio per mile, the tower
height becomes 111 miles.  This is clearly above the significant
atmosphere.  A rocket launched from the top of the tower will still
have to provide orbital velocity, but atmospheric drag and g-losses
will be almost eliminated.  G-losses are the component of
rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity,
but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity.  Thus
they represent wasted thrust.  Together with drag, rockets starting
from the ground have a 15% velocity penalty to contend with.

This analysis is simplified, in that it does not consider wind
loads.  These will require more structural support over the first
15 miles of height.  Above that, the air pressure drops to a low
enough value for it not to be a big factor.

bottom of the ninth against none other than Dennis Eckersley to give the
Tigers the victory.  Barnes also had an RBI single to score Thurmond to
tie the score in the ninth, also off Eckersley (sp?).

The A's got their runs on an RBI single by McGwire in the 1st and a solo
homer by Reuben Sierra in the 6th.  Deer doubled home Kirk Gibson in the
7th for the other Tiger run.

John Doherty pitched another strong game for the Tigers, once again lasting
through the seventh inning.  He was relieved by Bolton and then David Haas
in the 8th, and Haas got the win.  Bobby Witt started for the A's, and was
replaced by Honeycutt in the 6th, followed by Goose Gossage in the 8th, and
finally Eckersly in the 9th.  Doherty gave up both of the A's runs, while
Witt gave up the first Tiger run and Eckerseley gave up the last two.

In the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson said
its one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career.  It

Institute who have asked me to post this announcement.  (I have done
some editing, but the contents is unchanged from the original

For those of you not familiar with the Moscow Aviation Institute, it is
the leading Russian school of higher education dedicated to the training
of aircraft and spacecraft designers.  It specializes in airframe
design, powerplant design, control systems, and power systems.
Virtually all of the major former Soviet airframe designers (Tupolev,
Su, Iluchine, Migoyan, etc.) were schooled at MAI.

I had the opportunity to tour the two museums that are maintained at
MAI.  The aircraft include Mig23, Su 27, Yak 38, the cockpit of an
F-111(!), among others.  It was a fascinating and eye opening
experience, expecially given the fact that the museum was, until a year
or so ago, closed to virtually everyone.  I also had the opportunity to
see some of the experiments being conducted with plasma drive engines
for future space craft use.

If you have any questions about the Institute, or the program, I would
be glad to try and answer them.  The institute, and most of it's faculty

Having thought about this, why don't you project the 2 lines onto the 2d
plane formed by the lines.  Do an intersection calculation in the plane in
2D, where you're guaranteed a unique solution (unless they're parallel which
won't happen in this case), and then use parametric distance along the lines
from the circle centres to determine the exact point of interest.  This
bypasses the messy error propogation required to do the calculation in 3d.

Hope I haven't put my foot in it again!

"ACLU Official Policies.

Policy 18, for example, opposes rating systems for motion
pictures: ""Industry sponsored ratings systems create the
potential for constraining the creative process and thus
contracting the marketplace of ideas. Despite the stated goal of
providing guidance to parents, experience has shown that ratings
inevitably have serious chilling effects on freedom of
expression.""

In regards to the Pledge of Allegiance, the ACLU states in its
Policy 84: ""The insertion of the words `under God' into the
Pledge of Allegiance is a violation of the constitutional
principle of separation of Church and State.""

Policy 120 states that, ""Military conscription under any
circumstances is a violation of civil liberties and
constitutional guarantees."" The ACLU objects to the draft even
during wartime because of the ""anti-democratic power it gives
government to wage war without support of the people.""

Policy 125 states, ""The ACLU calls for a broad-based inquiry into
war crimes within the widest possible definition of war crimes
against humanity, and crimes against the peace, focusing upon the
actions of the United States military and other combatants
against the people of South Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia, and North
Vietnam.""

Policy 133 states, ""The ACLU recognizes that US government
reliance upon nuclear weaponry as a dominant element of foreign
and domestic policy, while propounded as a defense of democracy,
is in fact a great threat to civil liberties. Four decades of
adherence to this policy has fundamentally altered the nature of
our constitutional democratic process and poses a paramount
threat to our civil liberties.""

Policy 217 objects to roadblocks ""where drivers are stopped for
sobriety tests"" because they ""violate Fourth Amendment
principles."" 

Policy 242 states the following on criminal
sentencing: ""The most appropriate correctional approach is
reintegrating the offender into the community, and the goals of
reintegration are furthered much more readily by working with the
offender within the community than by incarceration. Probation
should be authorized by the legislature in every case; exceptions
to the principle are not favored, and any exceptions, if made,
should be limited to the most serious of offenses, such as murder
or treason.""

Basically, there are two algorithms determining whether a point is inside,
outside or on the polygon. The first one is Ray (or half line) method. In
this method, you can draw any ray, if the number of the intersection point
of the ray and the polygon is even, then it is outside. If the number is odd,
then it is inside. Of cause, you have to deal with the special cases which
may make you headache.

The second method is PI algorithm. Draw the lines between the point and
all the vertices on the polygon. Calculate and sum the angles of the
successive lines. If the result is 2*PI, then it is inside. If PI, then
it is on the polygon. Otherwise it is outside.

My experience tells the second method is relible.

Well it rolled out two weeks ago. As we speak it is at White Sands getting
ready. I would have called my sources for the latest but they are all out
of town (in NM).

As for the future, there is at least $5M in next years budget for work
on SSRT. They (SDIO) have been looking for more funds and do seem to have
some. However, SDIO is not (I repeat, is not) going to fund an orbital
prototype. The best we can hope from them is to 1) keep it alive for
another year, and 2) fund a suborbital vehicle which MIGHT (with
major modifications) just make orbit. There is also some money for a
set of prototype tanks and projects to answer a few more open questions.

Better news comes from the new Spacelifter effort. The USAF managers of
this program are very open to SSTO and will have about $50M next
year for studies. This would be enough to bring DC-Y to PDR.

Now not all of this money will go to DC but a good case could be made
for spending half on DC.

I wouldn't give baserunning that much value.

The above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well.  If
Olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an
extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold
at third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than
Alomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a
double.)

Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that
the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  No
team in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players
than others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well
in the 1950's for all teams.  

Bill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used Harmon
Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with
38 times caught stealing.  Yet they scored slightly more runs than
predicted by Runs Created.

being an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he was
only 21 or 22 (can't remember).  But who did the Sox have at first?
Calderon?  Martinez?  Kittle?  The spot was there.  The talent was
there.  Sure, I say go for it.

I am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas
was after his AA season in 1989, and I am not convinced that Olson/
Berryhill are nearly as bad as Kittle/Martinez were.

BTW, I don't think Thomas was hurt by those three months.






Well, if we can't compare our guy to one of the best in the game,
let's compare our decision to one of the most ""Boneshead"", right?

Cal Eldred was 24 when he came up, with a full season at AAA and a
longer minor league career.  Frankly, I don't know why he didn't
make the club in 1992.  Bones is a year younger with a lousy prior
history, and just watching him makes me think that I missed a 
career as a big-league pitcher.  No one -  I repeat NO ONE  -
laughed louder than I did at the Sheffield trade.  (Though I guess
Mieske has a future.)

(I take it back. McIlvaine may have laughed louder.)




aw, gee, shucks.  thanks guy.  except I missed the part where SDCN's
admit they're wrong.

14. Plotting packages
=====================

Gnuplot 3.2
-----------
  It is one of the best 2- and 3-D plotting packages, with
  online help.It's a command-line driven interactive function plotting utility
  for UNIX, MSDOS, Amiga, Archimedes, and VMS platforms (at least!).
  Freely distributed, it supports many terminals, plotters, and printers
  and is easily extensible to include new devices.
  It was posted to comp.sources.misc in version 3.0, plus 2 patches.
  You can practically find it everywhere (use Archie to find a site near you!).
  The comp.graphics.gnuplot newsgroup is devoted to discussion of Gnuplot.

Xvgr and Xmgr (ACE/gr)
-----------------------
  Xmgr is an XY-plotting tool for UNIX workstations using
  X or OpenWindows. There is an XView version called xvgr for
  Suns. Collectively, these 2 tools are known as ACE/gr.
  Compiling xmgr requires the Motif toolkit version 1.1
  and X11R4 - xmgr will not compile under X11R3/Motif 1.0x.

  Check at ftp.ccalmr.ogi.edu [129.95.72.34} in
  /CCALMR/pub/acegr/xmgr-2.09.tar.Z (Motif version)

15. Image analysis software - Image processing and display
==========================================================

PC and Mac-based tools (multi-platform software)
======================

IMDISP
------
  IMDISP Written at JPL and other NASA sites. Can do simple display,
  enhancing, smoothing and so on. Works with the FITS and VICAR/PDS
  data formats of NASA. Can read TIFF images, if you know their dimensions
  [PC and Macs]

LabVIEW 2
---------
  LabVIEW is used as a framework for image processing tools. It provides a
  graphical programming environment using block diagram sketch is the
  ""program"" with graphical elements representing the programming elements.
  Hundreds of functions are already available and are connected using a
  wiring tool to create the block diagram (program).  Functions that the
  block diagrams represent include digital signal processing and
  filtering, numerical analysis, statistics, etc.  The tool allows any
  Virtual Instrument (VI, a software file that looks and acts like a real
  laboratory instrument) to be used as a part of any other virtual
  instrument.

  National Instruments markets plug-in digital signal processing (DSP)
  boards for Macintoshs and PC compatables that allow real-time
  acquisition and analysis at a personal computer.  New software tools for
  DSP are allowing engineers to harness the power of this technology. The
  tools range from low-level debugging software to high-level block
  diagram development software.  There are three levels of DSP programming
  associated with the NB-DSP2300 board and LabVIEW:
  Use of the NB-DSP2300 Analysis Library: FFTs, power spectra, filters
  routines callable from THINK C and Macintosh Programers Workshop (MPW) C
  that execute on the NB-DSP2300 board. There is an analysis Virtual
  Interface Library of ready-to-use VIs optimized for the NB-DSP2300.

  Use of the National Instruments Developers Toolkit that includes an
  optimizing C compiler, an assembler and a linker for low-level
  programming of the DSP hardware.  This approach offers the highest level
  of performance but is the must difficult in terms of ease of use.

  Use of the National Instruments Interface Kit software package which has
  utility functions for memory management data communications and
  downloading code to the NB-DSP2300 board. (This is the easiest route for
  the development of custom code.)

Ultimage Concept VI
-------------------
  Concept VI  by Graftek-France is a family of image processing Virtual
  Instruments (VIs) that give LabVIEW 2 (described above) users high-end
  tools for designing, integrating and monitoring imaging control systems.
  A VI is a software file that looks and acts like a real laboratory
  instrument. Typical applications for Concept VI include thermography,
  surveillance, machine vision, production testing, biomedical imaging,
  electronic microscopy and remote sensing.

  Ultimage Concept VI addresses applications which require further
  qualitative and quantitative analysis.  It includes a complete set of
  functions for image enhancement, histogram equalization, spatial and
  frequency filtering, isolation of features, thresholding, mathematical
  morphology analysis, density measurement, object counting, sizing and
  characterization.

  The program loads images with a minimum resolution of 64 by 64, a pixel
  depth of 8, 16, or 32 bits, and one image plane.  Standard input and
  output formats include PICT, TIFF, SATIE, and AIPD.  Other formats can
  be imported.

  Image enhancement features include lookup table transformations, spatial
  linear and non-linear filters, frequency filtering, arithmetic and logic
  operations, and geometric transformations, among others.  Morphological
  transformations include erosion, dilation, opening, closing, hole
  removal, object separation, and extraction of skeletons, among others.
  Quantitative analysis provides for objects' detection, measurement, and
  morphological distribution.  Measures include area, perimeter, center of
  gravity, moment of inertia, orientation, length of relevant chords, and
  shape factors and equivalence.  Measures are saved in ASCII format.  The
  program also provides for macro scripting and integration of custom
  modules.

  A 3-D view command plots a perspective data graph where image intensity
  is depicted as mountains or valleys in the plot.  The histogram tool can
  be plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. The twenty-eight
  arithmetic and logical operations provide for: masking and averaging
  sections of images, noise removal, making comparisons, etc.  There are
  13 spatial filters that alter pixel intensities based on local
  intensity.  These include high-pass filters for contrast and outlines.
  The frequency data resulting from FFT analysis can be displayed as
  either the (real , imaginary ) components or the (phase, magnitude)
  data.  The morphological transformations are useful for data sharpening
  and defining objects or for removing artifacts.

  The transformations include: thresholding, eroding, dilating and even
  hole filling.

  The program's quantitative analysis measurements include: area,
  perimeter, center of mass, object counts, and angle between points.

  707-579-1733

IPLab Spectrum
--------------
  IPLAB Spectrum supports image processing and analysis but lacks the
  morphology and quantitative analysis features provided by
  Graftek-FranceUs Ultimage Concept VI.  Using scripting tools, the user
  tells the system the operations to be performed. The problem is that far
  too many basic operations require manual intervention. The tool
  supports: FFTs, 16 arithmetic operations for pixel alteration, and a
  movie command for cycling through windows.


Macintosh-based tools
=====================

NCSA Image, NCSA PalEdit and more
---------------------------------
  NCSA provides a whole suite of public-domain visualization tools for the
  Macintosh, primarily aimed at researchers wanting to visualize results
  from numerical modelling calculations.  These applications,
  documentation, and source code are available for anonymous ftp from
  ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu. Commercial versions of the NCSA programs have been
  developed by Spyglass.

  Available at alw.nih.gov (128.231.128.7) or (preferably)
  zippy.nimh.nih.gov [128.231.98.32], directory:/pub/image.
  It has painting and image manipulation tools, a macro language,
  tools for measuring areas, distances and angles, and for counting
  things. Using a frame grabber card, it can record sequences of
  images to be played back as a movie. It can invoke user-defined
  convolution matrix filters, such as Gaussian. It can import raw
  data in tab-delimited ASCII, or as 1 or 2-byte quantities. It also
  does histograms and even 3-D plots. It is limited to 8-bits/pixel,
  though the 8 bits map into a color lookup table. It runs on any Mac
  that has a 256-color screen and a FPU (or get the NonFPU version
  from zippy.nimh.nih.gov)

  analysis. It provides a complete language for the capture, enhancement,
  and extraction of quantitative information from gray-scale images.
  TCL_Image has over 200 functions for image processing, and contains the
  other elements needed in a full programming language for algorithm
  development -- variables and control structures.  It is easily
  extensible through ""script"" (or indirect command) files. These script
  files are simply text files that contain TCL-Image commands.  They are
  executed as normal commands and include the ability to pass parameters.
  The direct capture of video images is supported via popular frame
  grabber boards.  TCL-Image comes with the I-View utility that provides
  conversion between common image file types, such as PICT2 and TIFF.""

  Perceptics 725 Pellissippi Parkway Knoxville, TN 37933 615-966-9200

Satellite Image Workshop
------------------------
  It comes with a number of satellite pictures (raw data) and does all
  sorts of image enhancing on it. You'll need at least a Mac II with co-
  processor; a 256 color display and a large harddisk. The program doesn't
  run under system 7.x.ATE1 V1

-----------------------
  ""An electronic imaging software system that performs interactive image
  analysis and scientific 2D and 3D plotting.""

  Paragon Imagine 171 Lincoln St. Lowell, MA 01852 508-441-2112

Adobe Photoshop
---------------

  The tool supports Rtrue colorS with 24-bit images or 256 levels of grey
  scale.  Once an image has been imported it can be Rre-touchedS with
  various editing tools typical of those used in Macintosh-based RpaintS
  applications.  These include an eraser, pencil, brush and air brush.
  Advanced RpasteS tools that control the interaction between a pasted
  selection and the receiving site have also been incorporated.  For
  example, all red pixels in a selection can easily be preventing from
  being pasted. Photoshop has transparencies ranging from 0 to 100%,
  allowing you to create ghost overlays.  RPhoto-editingS tools include
  control of the brightness and contrast, color balancing, hue/saturation
  modification and spectrum equalization.  Images can be subjected to
  various signal processing algorithms to smooth or sharpen the image,
  blur edges, or locate edges.  Image scaling is also supported.

  For storage savings, the images can be compressed using standard
  algorithms, including externally supplied compression such as JPEG,
  availlable from Storm Technologies. The latest version of Adobe
  Photoshop supports the import of numerous image formats including: EPSF,
  EPSF, TIFF, PICT resource, Amiga IFF/ILBM, CompuServe GIF, MacPaint,
  PIXAR, PixelPaint, Scitex CT, TGA and ThunderScan..

ColorStudio and ImageStudio
---------------------------
  ColorStudio is an image-editing and paint package from Letraset that has
  more features than Adobe Photoshop but is decidedly more complex and
  therefore more difficult to use.  Several steps are often required to
  accomplish that which can be done in a single step using Photoshop.  The
  application requires a great deal of available disk space as one can
  easily end up with images in the 30 MB range.  The program provides a
  variety of powerful selection tools including the ""auto selection tool""
  which lets the user choose image areas on the basis of color, close
  hues, color range and mask.

Dapple Systems
--------------
  ""High resolution image analysis software provides processing tools to
  work with multiple images, enhance and edit, and measure a variety of
  global or feature parameters, and interpret the data.""

  Dapple Systems, 355 W. Olive Ave, #100 Sunnyvale, CA 94086 408-733-3283

Digital Darkroom
----------------
  The latest release of Digital Darkroom has five new selection and
  editing tools for enhancing images. One such feature allows the user to
  select part of an image simply by ""painting"" it. A new polyline
  selection tool creates a selection tool for single pixel wide
  selections.  A brush lets the operator ""paint"" with a selected portion
  of the image. Note that this is not a true color image enhancement tool.
  This tool should be used when the user intends to operate in grey-scale
  images only.  It should be noted that Digital Darkroom is not as
  powerful as either Adobe Photoshop or ColorStudio.

Dimple
------
  It  is compatible with system 6.05 and system 7.0 , requires Mac LC or
  II series with 256 colours, with a recommended min of 6Mb of ram. It has
  the capability of reading Erdas files. Functions include; image
  enhancement, 3D and contour plots, image statistics, supervised and
  unsupervised classification, PCA and other image transformations. There
  is also a means (Image Operation Language or IOL) by which you can write
  your own transformations. There is no image rectification, however
  Dimple is compatable with MAPII. The latest version is 1.4 and it is in
  the beta stage of testing. Dimple was initially developed as a teaching
  tool and it is very good for this purpose.""

  ""Dimple  runs on a colour Macintosh.  It is a product still in its
  development phase.. i.e. it doesn't have all the inbuilt features of
  other packages, but is coming along nicely.  It has its own inbuilt
  language for writing ""programs"" for processing an image, defining
  convolution filters etc. Dimple is a full mac application with pull down
  menus etc... It is unprotected software.""

Enhance
-------
  Enhance has a RrulerS tool that supports measurements and additionally
  provides angle data. The tool has over 80 mathematical filter
  variations: ""Laplacian, medium noise filter"", etc.  Files can be saved
  as either TIFF, PICT, EPSF or text (however EPSF files can't be imported).

  MicroFrontier 7650 Hickman Road Des Moines, IA  50322 515-270-8109

Image Analyst
-------------
  An image processing product for users who need to extract quantitative
  data from video images.  Image Analyst lets users configure
  sophisticated image processing and measurement routines without the
  necessity of knowing a programming language.  It is designed for such
  tasks at computing number and size of cells in images projected by video
  cameras attached to microscopes, or enhancing and measuring distances in
  radiographs.

  Image Analyst provides users with an array of field-proven video
  analysis techniques that enable them to easily assemble a sequence of
  instructions to enhance feature appearance; count objects; determine
  density, shape, size, position, or movement; perform object feature
  extraction; and conduct textural analysis automatically.  Image Analyst
  works with either a framegrabber board and any standard video camera, or
  a disk-stored image.

  Within minutes, without the need for programming, the Image Analyst user
  can set up a process to identify and analyze any element of a image.
  Measurements and statistics can be automatically or semi-automatically
  generated from TIFF or PICT files or from captured video tape images.
  Image Analyst recognizes items in images based on their size, shape and
  position.  The tool provides direct support for the Data Translation and
  Scion frame grabbers. A menu command allows for image capture from a VCR
  video camera or other NTSC or PAL devices.

  There are 2 types of files, the image itself and the related Sequence
  file that holds the processing, measurements and analysis that the user
  defines.  Automated sequences are set up in Regions Of Interest (ROI)
  represented by movable, sizable boxes atop the image.  Inside a ROI, the
  program can find the distance between two edges, the area of a shape,
  the thickness of a wall, etc.  Image Analyst finds the center, edge and
  other positions automatically. The application also provides tools so
  that the user can work interactively to find the edge of object. It also
  supports histograms and a color look-up table (CLUT) tool.

  Erdas.  I have used RSVGA with 6 of 7 Landsat bands and it is a good
  starter program except for the obtuse manual""

IMAGINE-32
----------
  It's a 32 bit package [I suppose for PCs] called ""Imagine32""
  or ""Image32"" The program does a modest amount of image processing --add,
  subtract, multiply, divide, display, and plot an x or y cut across the image.
  It can also display a number of images simultaneously.
  The company is CompuScope, in Santa Barbara, CA. 

PC Vista
--------
  It was announced in the 1989 August edition of PASP.  It is known to
  be available from Mike Richmond, whose email addresses have been

	richmond@bllac.berkeley.edu
	richmond@bkyast.berkeley.edu

  and his s-mail address is:

  Michael Richmond,Astronomy Department, Campbell Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720

  The latest version of PC-Vista, version 1.7, includes not only the source
  code and help files, but also a complete set of executable programs and
  a number of sample FITS images. If you do wish to use the source code,
  you will need Microsoft C, version 5.0 or later; other compilers may work,
  but will require substantial modifications.

  To receive the documentation and nine double-density (360K) floppies
  (or three quad-density 3-1/2 inch floppies (1.44M) with everything on them,
  just send a request for PC-Vista, together with your name and a US-Mail
  address, to 

	Office of Technology Licensing
	2150 Shattuck Ave., Suite 510
	Berkeley, Ca. 94704

  Include a check (Traveller's Checks are fine) or purchase order for $150.00
  in U.S. dollars, if your address is inside the continental U.S., or $165.00
  otherwise, made out to Regents of the University of California
  to cover duplication and mailing costs.


SOFTWARE TOOLS
--------------
  It's a set of software ""tools"" put out by Canyon State
  Systems and Software. They are not free, but rather cheap at about $30 I
  heard. It will handle most all of the formats used by frame grabber
  software. 

MIRAGE
------
  It's image processing software written by Jim Gunn at the
  Astrophysics Dept at Princeton. It will run on a PC among other platforms.
  It is a Forth based system - i.e. a Forth language with many image
  processing displaying functions built in. 

DATA TRANSLATION SOURCE BOOK
----------------------------
  The Data Translation company in Massachusetts publishes a free book
  containing vendors of data analysis hardware and software which is
  compatible with Data Translation and other frame grabbers.
  Surely you can find much more PC-related stuff in it.

MAXEN386
--------
  A couple of Canadians have written a program named MAXEN386 which does
  maximum entropy image deconvolution. Their company is named Digital
  Signal Processing Software, or something like that, and the software is
  mentioned in an article in Astronomy Magazine, either Jan or Feb 92
  (an article on CCD's vs film). 

JANDEL SCIENTIFIC (JAVA)
------------------------
  Another software package (JAVA) is put out by Jandel Scientific. 
  Jandel Scientific, 65 Koch Road, Corte Madera, CA 94925, (415) 924-8640,
  (800) 874-1888.

Microbrian
----------
  Runs on an MS dos platform and uses a 32 bit graphics card
  (Vista), or an about to be released version will support a number of
  super VGA cards.  Its a full blown remote sensed data processing
  system.. It is menu driven (character based screen), but is does not use
  a windowed user interface. Its is hardware protected with a dongle.
  Mbrian = micro Barrier reef Image Anaysis System. It was developed by
  CSIRO (Commonwealth Scientific & Industrial Organization) and is
  marketed/ supported by:

  MPA Australia (51 Lusher Road, Croydon, Victoria

Unix-based tools
================

IRAF (Image Reduction and Analysis Facility)
--------------------------------------------
  Developed in the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, Kitt Peak AZ
  It is free, you can ftp it from tucana.noao.edu [140.252.1.1]
  and complement it with STSDAS from stsci.edu [130.167.1.2].
  Email to iraf@noao.edu for more details.
  Apparently this is one of the _de facto_ standards in the astronomical
  image community. They issue a newsletter also.
  They seem to support very well their users. Works with VMS also last
  I heard, and practically has its own shell on top of the VMS/Unix shells.

  It's suggested that you get a copy of saoimage for display under X windows.
  Very flexible/extendable  -- tons (literally 3 linear feet) of
  documentation for the general user, skilled user, and programmer.

ALV
---
  A Sun-specific image toolkit.  Version 2.0.6 posted to
  comp.sources.sun on 11dec89.  Also available via email to
  alv-users-request@cs.bris.ac.uk.

AIPS
----
  Astronomical Image Processing System.  Contact: aipsmail@nrao.edu
  (also see the UseNet Newsgroups alt.sci.astro.aips and sci.astro.fits)
  Built by NRAO (National Radio Astronomy Observatory, HQ in Charlottesville,
  VA, sites in NM, AZ, WV).  Software distributed by 9-track, Exabyte, DAT,
  or (non-anonymous) internet ftp.  Documentation (PostScript mostly)
  available via anonymous ftp to baboon.cv.nrao.edu (192.33.115.103),
  directory pub/aips and pub/aips/TEXT/PUBL.  Installation requires building
  the system and thus a Fortran and C compiler.
     This package can read and write FITS data (see sci.astro.fits), and is
  primarily for reduction, analysis, and image enhancement of Radio Astronomy
  data from radio telescopes, particularly the Very Large Array (VLA), a
  synthesis instrument.  It consists of almost 300 programs that do everything
  from copying data to sophisticated deconvolution, e.g. via maximum entropy.
  There is an X11-based Image tool (XAS) and a tek-compatible xterm-based
  graphics tool built into AIPS.  The XAS tool is modelled after the hardware
  functionality of the International Imaging Systems model 70 display unit and
  can do image arithmetic, etc.
    The code is mostly Fortran 77 with some system C language modules, and is
  available for Suns, IBM RS/6000, Dec/Ultrix, Convex, Cray (Unicos), and
  Alliant with support planned for HP-9000/7xx, Solaris 2.1, and maybe SGI.
     There is currently a project - ""AIPS++"" - underway to rewrite the
  algorithmic functionality of AIPS in a modern setting, using C++ and an
  object oriented approach.  Whereas AIPS is proprietary code (licensed for
  free to non-profit institutions) owner by NRAO and the NSF, AIPS++ will be
  in the public domain at some level, as it is an international effort with
  contributions from the US, Canada, England, the Netherlands, India, and
  Australia to name a few. 

LABOimage
---------
  (version 4.0 is out for X11) It's written in C, and currently
  runs on Sun 3/xxx, Sun 4/xxx (OS3.5, 4.0 and 4.0.3) under SunView.
  The expert system for image segmentation is written in Allegro Common Lisp.
  It was used on the following domains: computer science (image analysis), 
  medicine, biology, physics. It is distributed free of charge (source code).

DISIMP
------
  (Device Independent Software for Image Processing) is a powerful
  system providing both user friendliness and high functionality in
  interactive times.

  Feature Description

  DISIMP incorporates a rich library of image processing utilities and
  spatial data options. All functions can be easily accessed via the
  DISIMP executive. This menu is modular in design and groups image
  processes by their function. Such a logical structure means that
  complicated processes are simply a progression through a series of
  modules.

  Processes include image rectification, classification (unsupervised and
  supervised), intensity transformations, three dimensional display and
  Principal Component Analysis. DISIMP also supports the more simple and
  effective enhancement techniques of filtering, band subtraction and
  ratioing.

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Running on UNIX workstations, DISIMP is capable of processing the more
  computational intensive techniques in interactive processing times.
  DISIMP is available in both Runtime and Programmer's environments. Using
  the Programmers environment, utilities can be developed for specific
  applications programs.

  Graphics are governed by an icon-based Display Panel which allows quick
  enhancments of a displayed image. Manipulations of Look Up Tables,
  colour stretches, changes to histograms, zooming and panning can be
  interactively driven through this control.

  A range of geographic projections enables DISIMP to integrate data of
  image, graphic and textual types. Images can be rectified by a number of
  coordinate systems, providing the true geographic knowledge essential
  for ground truthing. Overlays of grids, text and vector data can be
  added to further enhance referenced imagery.

  The system is a flexible package allowing users of various skill levels
  to determine their own working environment, including the amount of help
  required. DISIMP comes fully configured with no optional extras. The
  purchase price includes all functionality required for professional
  processing of remote sensed data.

Global Imaging Software
-----------------------
  ""We use Global Imaging Software to process AVHRR data, from the dish to
  the final display. Select a chunk of five band data from a pass,
  automatic navigation, calibrate it to Albedo and Temp, convert that to
  byte, register it to predesigned window, all relatively automatically
  and carefree.

  It has no classification routines to speak of, but it isn't that
  difficult to write your own with their programmer's module.

  Very small operation: one designs, one codes, one sells. Been around for
  a number of years, sold to Weather Service and Navy.  Runs on HP9000
  with HP-UX.  Supports 24-bit display""

HIPS
----
(Human   Information   Processing Laboratory's Image Processing System)

  Michael Landy co-wrote and sell a general-purpose package for image
  processing which has been used for basically all the usual image
  processing applications (robotics, medical, satellite, engineering, oil
  exploration, etc.).  It is called HIPS, and deals with sequences of
  multiband images in the same way it deals with single images.  It has
  been growing since we first wrote it, both by additions from us as well
  as a huge user-contributed library.

  Feature description

  HIPS  is  a  set  of  image  processing  modules  which together provide
  a  powerful  suite  of  tools  for  those interested in research,
  system  development  and  teaching. It  handles  sequences  of  images
  (movies)  in precisely the same manner as single frames.

  Programs and subroutines have been developed  for simple image
  transformations, filtering, convolution, Fourier and other transform
  processing, edge detection  and line  drawing   manipulation, digital
  image compression and transmission  methods, noise generation, and image
  statistics computation. Over 150 such  image transformation programs
  have been developed.  As a result, almost any image processing  task
  can be performed quickly and conveniently. Additionally, HIPS allows
  users to easily integrate  their  own custom  routines.   New users
  become effective using HIPS on their first day.

  HIPS features images that are  self-documenting.   Each image stored  in
  the  system  contains  a  history  of the transformations that have been
  applied to that image.   HIPS includes  a  small  set of subroutines
  which primarily deals with a standardized  image sequence  header,  and
  a  large library  of  image  transformation tools in the form of UNIX
  ``filters''.  It comes complete with source  code,  on-line manual
  pages, and on-line documentation.

  Host Configuration Requirements

  Originally  developed at  New  York  University,  HIPS  now represents
  one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image  processing
  environments currently available.  It runs under the UNIX operating
  system.  It is modular  and  flexible, provides automatic documentation
  of its actions, and is almost entirely independent of special equipment.
  HIPS is now in use on a variety of computers including Vax and
  Microvax, Sun, Apollo,  Masscomp,  NCR Tower, Iris, IBM AT, etc.
  For image display and input, drivers are supplied for the Grinnell and
  Adage (Ikonas) image processors, and the Sun-2, Sun-3, Sun- 4, and
  Sun-386i consoles.  We also  supply  user-contributed drivers  for  a
  number of  other framestores and windowing packages (Sun gfx, Sun
  console, Matrox VIP-1024, ITI IP-512, Lexidata,  Macintosh II, X
  windowing system, and Iris).  The Hipsaddon package includes an
  interface  for the  CRS-4000. It  is  a  simple matter to interface HIPS
  with other frame- stores, and we can put interested users in touch with
  users who  have interfaced HIPS with the Arlunya and Datacube Max-
  Video. HIPS can be easily adapted for other  image  display devices
  because 98% of HIPS is machine independent.

  Availability

  HIPS has proven itself a highly flexible  system,  both as  an
  interactive  research tool, and for more production- oriented tasks. It
  is both easy to use, and quickly adapted and extended to new uses. HIPS
  is supplied on magnetic tape in UNIX tar format (either reel- to-reel or
  Sun  cartridge), and comes with source code, libraries, a library of
  convolu- tion masks, and on-line documentation and manual pages.

MIRA
----
[ Please DON'T confuse that with the Thalmanns animation system from
  Montreal. These are altogether different beasts! - nfotis ]

  MIRA stands for Microcomputer Image Reduction and Analysis.  MIRA gives
  workstation level performance on 386/486 DOS computers using SVGA cards in
  256 color modes up to 1024x768. MIRA contains a very handsome/functional
  GUI which is mouse and keystroke operated. MIRA reads/writes TIFF and FITS
  formats, native formats of a number of CCD cameras, and uncompressed binary
  images in byte, short integer, and 4-byte real pixel format in 1- or 2-
  dimensions. The result of an image processing operation can be short integer
  or real pixels, or the same as that of the input image. MIRA does the
  operation using short or floating point arithmetic to maintain the precision
  and accuracy of the pixel format. Over 100 functions are hand-coded in
  assembly language for maximum speed on the Intel hardware.  The entire
  graphical interface is also written in assembly language to maximize
  the speed of windowing operations.  Windows for 2-d image and 1-d image/data
  display and analysis have dedicated cursors which read position and value
  value in real time as you move the mouse.  There are also smooth, real time
  contrast and brightness stretch and panning of a magnified portion of
  the displayed image(s), all operated by the mouse. A wide selection of
  grayscale, pseudocolor, and random palettes is provided, and other 
  palettes can be generated.


Supported functions include such niceties as the following:

o  image & image: + - / * interpolation
o  image & constant: + - / *
o  unary operations: abs value, polynomial of pixel value, chs, 1/x, log,
   byteswap, clip values at upper/lower limits, short->real or real->short.
o  combine images by mean, median, mode, or sum of pixel values, with or
   without autoscaling to mean, median, or mode of an image section.
o  convolutions/filters: Laplacian, Sobel edge operator, directional gradient,
   line, Gaussian, elliptical and rectangular equal weight filters, unsharp
   masking, median filters, user defined filter kernel.  Ellipse, rectangle,
   line, gradient, Gaussian, and user defined filters can be rotated to
   any specified angle.
o  CCD data reduction: flat fielding, dark subtraction, column over/underscan
   bias removal, remove bad pixels and column defects, normalize to
   region target mean, median, or modal value.
o  create subimage, mosaic m x n 1-d or 2-d images to get larger image,
   collapse 2-d image into 1-d image.
o  plot 1-d section or collapsed section of 2-d image, plot histogram of
   region of an image.
o  review/change image information/header data, rename keywords, plot
   keyword values for a set of images.
o  luminance/photometry: elliptical or circular aperture photometry,
   brightness profile, isophotal photometry between set of upper & lower
   luminances, area and luminance inside traced polygon. Interactive
   background fitting and removal from part or all of image, fit elliptical
   aperture shape to image isophotes. 
o  interactive with 2-d image: contrast/brightness, x- y- or diagonal plot
   of pixel values, distance between two points, compute region stats,`
   centroid, pan to x,y location or image center, zoom 1/16 to 10 times,
   change cursor to rectangle crosshair, full image crosshair, or off, and
   adjust cursor size on image. Select linear, log or gamma transfer function
   or histogram equalization.

Not so.  Surveys have shown while the public thinks certain types
of gun control may be acceptable they do believe they have an
individual right to keep and bear arms, and that the police should
not have /discretion/ over who may and may not own firearms.

As for your claim, I think Clinton has a big fight ahead of him if

 President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A
 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President 
Clinton in a question and answer session with the press:

1:36 P.M. EDT

     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal
agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law
against the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled
weaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.
Because the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day
standoff ensued.

     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every
reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without
bloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were
ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were
dealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably
insane.

     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both
federal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,
responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the
action against the compound in February.  Given his inclination
towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no
provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal
agents against the compound.

     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on
an operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on
Koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.
The plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even
in the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause
permanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people
in the compound to come outside and to surrender.

     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I
discussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I
thought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what
she thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the
implementation of the decision.

     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.
Mr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal
agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his
captives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not
survive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate
responsibility for the carnage that ensued.

     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the
future.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and
Treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to
uncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been
dne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent
professional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I
expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required
to complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to
cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can
continue to be fully accountable to the American people.

     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney
General, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the
front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult
circumstances.

     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry
for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end
of this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be
tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David
Koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over
the last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult
situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will
be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future
will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what
has been learned now.

     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,
after 51 days, you decided --

     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is
that Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation
with --

     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go
first and then the other.

     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --

     Q  Mr. President --

     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I
can't do it at once.

     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about
the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General
that the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another
step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she
described generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted
to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause
permanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it
very difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was
hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.

     I was further told that under no circumstances would our
people fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to
shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and
there would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful
lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.
There were no shots coming back from the government side.

     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I
asked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons
I was given were the following:

     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the
federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the
quality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be
needed in other parts of the country.

     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had
never seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced
that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to
be made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult
members to come out.

     Number three, that the danger of their doing something
to themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with
the passage of time.

     And number four, that they had reason to believe that
the children who were still inside the compound were being abused
significantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and
unsafe conditions.

     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.
The second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had
given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and
evaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said
that the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were
convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only
increase with the passage of time.

     The third question I asked was, has the military been
consulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,
that's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious
that this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military
people were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some
of the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the
military had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they
had, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one
minor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military
-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming
significance.

     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I
said that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she
should proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that
today.

     Q  Mr. President --

     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.

     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --
reported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were
trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?

     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only
reason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only
reason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to
add to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather
late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who
had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into
custody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events
to unfold.

     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people
speculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General
on the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.
I called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry
King Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it
is not possible for a President to distance himself from things that
happen when the federal government is in control.

     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised
would be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the
Attorney General should resign because some religious fanatics
murdered themselves.  (Applause.)

     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this
life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These
people killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were
heavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,
and they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to
avoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate
themselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the
children.

     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,
is when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you
to tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why
you believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she
said, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those
children are still being abused and that they're in increasingly
unsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier
with time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for
that.  So that is where I think things stand.

     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was
mishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of
patience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really
decide that way?

     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume
is just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has
done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of
time.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the
World Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry
to analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we
should have known?  Is there some other question they should have
asked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say
for sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make
the outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want
the inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have
some independent law enforcement people, not political people, but
totally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best
evidence we have.

     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of
fanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it
again.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,
particularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is
important to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the
people who killed others and then killed themselves.

     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options
presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from
February 28th until yesterday?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all
along the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go
back -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good
job of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued
any number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them
early on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of
the other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to
be some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the
authorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things
just began to spin downward.

     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened
yesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not
involve other options except whether we should take more time with
the present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they
wanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get
people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.
That's what they thought.

     Q  Did the government know that the children did not
have gas masks?

     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are
you in agreement with that?

     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do
whatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the
Treasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring
in some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any
congressional committees want to look into it, we will fully
cooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the
most well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the
country.",politics

       Here's a question:  If most marijuana is domestic and
producing it here is economical, why would we expect it to be
imported?


       Yet it was done.  Done quite successfully for a number of years.
*Somebody* thought it was worth the risk.


       Your assumption is that this ""low"" dollar/pound area is
sufficiently low as to make gun-running unprofitable.  On what
do you base this?  

       And given that smuggling channels are already established,
and given the economies of scale, would it really add significantly
more expense to start smuggling firearms, especially considering
doing so would be less hazardous (in terms of getting caught) than
drugs?


       Now *that* was a jump.  In any case, define ""local.""  It's
a big country.
 

       Wow, you gotta love the speculation.

       As I posted before, we import billions upon billions of raw
ores across the Mexican border.  Not only that but ships come in and
out of U.S. harbors every day full stuff.  And customs doesn't even
have the extra advantage of being able to sniff them out.  

       I'd be willing to wager that a shipload of handguns would be
worth more than a shipload of raw ore, *and* you're virtually guaranteed
to get it past customs, because they'd have to hand search every hold of
every ship which came through.

       It's not simply a matter of how much money are they worth, but how
much *more* money are they worth than other goods, based on the likelihood
of being caught.  Less money than drugs, but also a safer thing to smuggle.

No.  There are two problems here:

(1) Peter died two millenia ago.  The original letters he wrote have
long since decayed into dust.  If he were alive today and I could
question him, then this might lend credibility to your claims (but
probably not much, because after all, I've heard people claim with all
sincerity that they've spoken with Elvis recently).  But after his
death, Peter's writings were transcribed by monks for centuries, and I
find it hard to believe that one of them somewhere didn't decide to
change the wording of something to make it (in his opinion) a little
easier to understand.

(2) Even if Peter did witness the miracles of Jesus two millenia ago,
that doesn't mean that your deity is what the Bible says it is (God
might just be Satan, trying to convince everyone that he's a nice
guy), or even that your deity is still alive and active in the world
today.

Nice try, but it just isn't enough to convince me, especially since
your wild claims about your deity seem to fly in the face of the way
I've observed the world to work.  Please find something more compelling.

Bill, I have taken the time to explain that biblical scholars consider the
Josephus reference to be an early Christian insert.  By biblical scholar I mean
an expert who, in the course of his or her research, is willing to let the
chips fall where they may.  This excludes literalists, who may otherwise be
defined as biblical apologists.  They find what they want to find.  They are
not trustworthy by scholarly standards (and others).

Why an insert?  Read it - I have, a number of times.  The passage is glaringly
out of context, and Josephus, a superb writer, had no such problem elsewhere 
in his work.  The passage has *nothing* to do with the subject matter in which 
it lies.  It suddenly appears and then just as quickly disappears.

Until you can demonstrate how and why the scholarly community is wrong about
the Josephus insert, your ""proof"" is meaningless and it should not be repeated
here.  What's more, even if Josephus happened to be legitimate, it would ""prove""
nothing.  Scholars speak of the ""weight of evidence.""  Far more independent
evidence would be required to validate your claim.  Until forthcoming, your
belief is based on faith.  That's OK, but you exceed your rights when you pass
faith off as fact.

As for the gospels, there are parallels, but there are also glaring
inconsistencies and contradictions.  Shouldn't a perfect canon be perfect? 
Shouldn't there be absolutely no room for debate?  I suggest you read _Gospel 
Fictions_ by Randel Helms, and _The Unauthorized Version_ by Robin Fox (for 
Herb Huston, no known kinship or familial relationship, but we do indeed share 
an evolutionary ancestry).

The fact that there are inconsistencies, gaps and contradictions does not deny
your position.  On the other hand, neither do the gospels ""prove"" your faith. 
Independent evidence is necessary, and I know of none (which we have already
discussed, and so far you have not provided any).  Until then, its faith. 
Moreover, you have committed a fundamental error in logic.  You have attempted
to ""prove"" your claim with that which you want to prove.  Its no different than
saying ""I am right because I say so.""  

Your logic is full of circles.  It reminds me a bit of the 1910 Presbyterian 
General Assembly.  The assembly defined five fundamentals (this is where
""fundamentalist"" came from) of orthodox Protestant Christianity, to wit: 1)
Jesus performed miracles, 2) Jesus was born of a virgin, 3) Jesus was bodily
resurrected, 4) Jesus' crucifixion atoned for human sin, and - here is the
clincher - 5) the bible is the inerrant word of God.  Presbyterians construe
""inerrant"" broadly as spritually inerrant.  Fundamentalists take the
first four as literally true, and then validate them with a literally inerrant
bible, which contains the first four, and which is the only thing known to 
contain the first four.  

Smoke and mirrors and wands and hand waving if ever there was!

Its faith, Bill.  You don't have any more or better truths than anyone else. 
Whatever works for you.  Just don't foist it on others.

The HGA isn't all that reflective in the wavelengths that might ""cook the

that the antenna _itself_ could not be exposed to Venus-level sunlight,

as electronics, that they were worried about.)  Thus it had to remain

Subject: White House outlines options for station, Russian cooperation
Date: Tue, 06 Apr 93 16:00:21 PDT
From: Richard Buenneke <buenneke@austen.rand.org>

4/06/93:  GIBBONS OUTLINES SPACE STATION REDESIGN GUIDANCE

NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C.
April 6, 1993

RELEASE:  93-64

        Dr.  John H.  Gibbons, Director, Office of Science and Technology
Policy, outlined to the members-designate of the Advisory Committee on the
Redesign of the Space Station on April 3, three budget options as guidance
to the committee in their deliberations on the redesign of the space
station.

        A low option of $5 billion, a mid-range option of $7 billion and a
high option of $9 billion will be considered by the committee.  Each
option would cover the total expenditures for space station from fiscal
year 1994 through 1998 and would include funds for development,
operations, utilization, Shuttle integration, facilities, research
operations support, transition cost and also must include adequate program
reserves to insure program implementation within the available funds.

        Over the next 5 years, $4 billion is reserved within the NASA
budget for the President's new technology investment.  As a result,
station options above $7 billion must be accompanied by offsetting
reductions in the rest of the NASA budget.  For example, a space station
option of $9 billion would require $2 billion in offsets from the NASA
budget over the next 5 years.

        Gibbons presented the information at an organizational session of
the advisory committee.  Generally, the members-designate focused upon
administrative topics and used the session to get acquainted.  They also
received a legal and ethics briefing and an orientation on the process the
Station Redesign Team is following to develop options for the advisory
committee to consider.

        Gibbons also announced that the United States and its
international partners -- the Europeans, Japanese and Canadians -- have
decided, after consultation, to give ""full consideration"" to use of
Russian assets in the course of the space station redesign process.

        To that end, the Russians will be asked to participate in the
redesign effort on an as-needed consulting basis, so that the redesign
team can make use of their expertise in assessing the capabilities of MIR
and the possible use of MIR and other Russian capabilities and systems.
The U.S. and international partners hope to benefit from the expertise of
the Russian participants in assessing Russian systems and technology.  The
overall goal of the redesign effort is to develop options for reducing
station costs while preserving key research and exploration capabilitiaes.
Careful integration of Russian assets could be a key factor in achieving
that goal.

        Gibbons reiterated that, ""President Clinton is committed to the
redesigned space station and to making every effort to preserve the
science, the technology and the jobs that the space station program
represents.  However, he also is committed to a space station that is well
managed and one that does not consume the national resources which should
be used to invest in the future of this industry and this nation.""

        NASA Administrator Daniel S.  Goldin said the Russian
participation will be accomplished through the East-West Space Science
Center at the University of Maryland under the leadership of Roald
Sagdeev.",space

triangulates them, bevelizes them and extrudes them to result in a generic
3d object which could be used with PoV f.i.

The problem I'm currently stuck on is that theres no algorithm which
triangulates any arbitrary polygonal shape. Delaunay seems to be limited
to convex hulls. Constrained delaunay may be okay, but I have no code
example of how to do it.

Another way to do the bartman may be

- TGA2POV
- A selfmade variation of this, using heightfields.

  Create a b/w picture (BIG) of the text you need, f.i. using a PostScript
  previewer. Then, use this as a heightfield. If it is white on black,
  the heightfield is exactly the images white parts (it's still open
  on the backside). To close it, mirror it and compound it with the original.

Example:

object {
   union {
      height_field { gif ""abp2.gif"" }
      height_field { gif ""abp2.gif"" scale <1 -1 1>}
   }
   texture {
      Glass
   }
   translate <-0.5 0 -0.5>      //center
   rotate <-90 0 0>             // rotate upwards
   scale  <10 5 100>            // scale bigger and thicker
   translate <0 2 0>            // final placement
}


abp2.gif is a GIF of arbitrary size containing ""ABP"" black on white in
Times-Roman 256 points.

#Rick Anderson replied to my letter with...
#
#ra> In article <C5ELp2.L0C@acsu.buffalo.edu>,
#ra>

(...)

# Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to
# differing interpretations of ""create,"" and say that many Christians may
# not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith
# on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is
# truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.

It may be ""irrelevant"" to you and *your* personal beliefs (or should I say
""bias""?), but it is relevant to me and many others.  You're right, ""the
bottom line IS truth,"" independant from you or anyone else.  Since you
proclaim ""truths"" as a self-proclaimed appointee, may I ask you by what
authority you do this?  Because ""it says so in the Bible?""  --Does the
Bible ""say so,"" or is it YOU, or someone else, who interprets whether a
scripture or doctrine conforms to your particular liking or ""disapproval""?

Excuse moi, but your line of ""truths"" haven't moved me one bit to persuade
me that my beliefs are erroneous.  Of all the ""preachers"" of ""truth"" on
this net, you have struck me as a self-righteous member of the wrecking
crew, with no positive message to me or any other Latter-day Saint...
BTW, this entire discussion reminds me a lot of the things said by Jesus
to the pharisees: ""ye hypocrite(s) . . . ye preach about me with your lips,
but your hearts are far removed from me...""

# Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created
# and eternally existent are equivalent, you say ""granted the Mormon
# belief..."" You can't grant your conclusion and then expect the point to
# have been addressed. In order to reply to the issue, you have to address
# and answer the point that was raised, and not just jump to the
# conclusion that you grant.

Sophistry.  Look who's talking: ""jumping to conclusions?""  You wouldn't do
that yourself, right?  All YOU address is your own convictions, regardless
whether we come up with any Biblical scriptures which supports our points
of view, because you reject such interpretations without any consideration
whatsoever.

#
# The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus
# is the creator of all. The contradiction that we have is that the LDS
# belief is that Jesus and Lucifer were the same.

A beautiful example of disinformation and a deliberate misrepresentation
of lds doctrine.  The former KGB would have loved to employ you.
Jesus and lucifer are not ""the same,"" silly, and you know it.

(...)

# The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is
# nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible
# says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:

Correction: it may contradict would YOU think the Bible says.  The Bible
indeed does teach that not all are children of God in the sense that they
""belong to"" or follow God in His footsteps.  Satan and his followers have
rebelled against God, and are not ""children (=followers/redeemed) of God,""
but it doesn't mean that they were not once created by God, but chose to
separate themselves from those who chose to follow God and His plan of
salvation.

#
#        The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the
#        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked ""one"";
#        (Matthew 13:38)

kingdom are those who have remained valiant in their testimony of Jesus
(and have shown ""works of repentance, etc.), and the children of the
wicked one are those who rebelled against God and the lamb.  The issue
of satan's spirit-origin (and of those who followed him) has not been
addressed in this and other verses you copied from your Bible.  You
purposefully obscured the subject by swamping your ""right"" with non-
related scriptures.

In this single posting of yours, I've seen more ""constructs of imagination""
than in all of the pro-lds mails combined I have read so far in this news
group.  First get your lds-facts straight before you dare preaching to us
about ""the only true God,"" whom you interpret according to your own likes
and dislikes, but whose image I cannot reconcile with what I know about
Him myself.  I guess your grandiose self-image does not allow for other
faiths, believing in the divinity of Jesus Christ, but in a different
way or fashion than your own.  Not that it really matters, the mission
and progress of the lds church will go on, boldly and nobly, and no mob
or opponent can stop the work from progressing, until it has visited
every continent, swept every clime, and sounded in every ear.

#  This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but
#  rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read
#  something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches.

Sigh.  ""What the Bible teaches""?  Or: ""what the bible teaches according to
Robert Weiss and co.?""  I respect the former, I reject the latter without
the remotest feeling that I have rejected Jesus.  On the contrary.  And by
the way, I do respect your interpretations of the Bible, I even grant you
being a Christian (following your own image of Him), as much as I am a
Christian (following my own image of Him in my heart).

#  Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of
#  Bruce McConkie and whether his views were 'official doctrine.' I don't
#  think that it matters if McConkie's views were canon. That is not the
#  issue.  Were McConkie's writings indicative of Mormon belief on this
#  subject is the real issue. The indication from Rick is that they may
#  certainly be.

The issue is, of course, that you love to use anything to either mis-
represent or ridicule the lds church.  The issue of ""official doctrine""
is obviously very important.  McConkie's views have been controversial
(e.g. ""The Seven Deadly Heresies"" has made me a heretic!  ;-) at best,
or erroneous at worst (""blacks not to receive the priesthood in this
dispensation"").  I respect him as someone who has made his valuable
contribution to the church, but I personally do NOT rely on his personal
interpretations (his book ""Mormon Doctrine"" is oftentimes referred to
as ""McConkie's Bible"" in mormon circles) on mormon doctrine.  I rather
look to official (doctrinal) sources, and... to Hugh Nibley's books!
(The last comment is an lds-insider reference.)  Summarizing: McConkie
was a wise man who contributed undoubtedly far more to the kingdom of
God than I have, but whose views are by no means dogma or accepted
doctrine, some of it clearly belongs to personal interpretation and
speculation.  But having said this, I find McConkie (even in his most
biased and speculative moments) far more thought-provoking than the
trash coming from your proverbial pen.  I'm somewhat appalled that I have
allowed myself to sink as low as you in this posting...

500,000 to 1,000,000 self-defense incidents a YEAR doesn't count with you?


Maybe they're just UNLUCKY.  If a rapist pulls a woman into an alley
in Boston, chances are almost certain that she won't be counted 
as one of those self-defenders because our local constabulary didn't
consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself.  Even though
the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the ""gun owner"" column.


Ironic words for somebody who lives in Florida.  The ""average threat
level"" in Florida has been REDUCED by a liberal CCW policy.  It's well
known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because 
they are less likely to be carrying than your natives.  Come on up to
Boston, or NYC, or Washington DC, and see how much diddlysquat the 
""average threat level in the country"" means to a resident there.


Sometimes this works.  Sometimes it just lands your good neighbors 
on the dance card for the next wave of drive-bys.  Someone here once
told a story about LA gangs moving into Phoenix.  I've misplaced the
original text, but the story started with one resident calling the 
cops on a gang member.  Sure enough, a few nights later, there was a 
drive-by performed at the resident's house.  Except that this time,
unlike in LA, the entire street came out and returned fire, putting
an end to the car's occupants.  The gang packed up and left.

Of course, in LA, or in a place like Florida after the hurricane,
your first problem is to FIND an officer to step up to and tell
anything.


Look, nobody is arguing this.  I have a fire extinguisher at home.  
That doesn't mean I can be careless about tossing my burnt matches 
on the carpet.  I live carefully, monitor the woodstove, get my flue
cleaned twice a year, and test my smoke alarms annually.  But if --
DESPITE all this -- a fire does start, it's too late for any of
these things EXCEPT the extinguisher.


You seem to be agreeing with your opponent.  You can't trust your
government to protect you from abusers and violators -- white-collar,
blue-collar, epauletted, or tank-shirted.  Ultimately, no one has the
power to enforce your ""rights"" but you.  Unless you've given up that 
power.


Too many people fit that category, that is true.  Some of us like to
believe that they are uninterested in the facts behind the case for gun 
ownership because they've been conditioned to believe that there AREN'T 
any.  You seem content to underestimate the electorate; I'm willing to
try to raise their consciousness.


I think we can.

HCI was founded in what, 1980?  In the mid-80's, they ran a ""One 
Million Strong!"" campaign for two years before reaching this goal.  
My understanding is that they ""reached"" it by the stratagem of including
wide classes of people other than dues-paying members.  (I can't speak
authoritatively on this -- maybe somebody else has details.)  Then they
started running a ""Two Million Strong!"" campaign for a while -- but they
let it slip into unannounced obscurity when it became clear that they
simply were never going to reach that level of membership.

In 1964, just after the commencement of the Dodd Hearings -- the starting
point of the modern gun-control movement, the NRA had a mere 625,000 members.  
By 1968, barely after the first murmurs of future registration, it had 
about a million.  Today, it has over three million members, making it the
third largest membership organization in the country (next to AARP and AAA).
And its membership is GROWING FASTER than at any previous time.  (Historical
figures from Kukla's ""Gun Control,"" pp. 61 and 420.)

As you say, many of the people in the middle of this debate are bemused
by their T-bones and MTV.  That leaves hard-core gun-owners against 
hard-core gun banners.

I know a number of ex-HCI members who have recently become NRA members.
I've never heard of a single one who has gone the other way.

Yes, I think we can and will win this one.

"Sterrenkundig symposium 'Compacte Objecten'
                                             op 26 april 1993


In het jaar 1643, zeven jaar na de oprichting van de
Universiteit van Utrecht, benoemde de universiteit haar
eerste sterrenkundige waarnemer. Hiermee ontstond de tweede
universiteitssterrenwacht ter wereld. Aert Jansz, de eerste
waarnemer, en zijn opvolgers voerden de Utrechtse sterrenkunde
in de daaropvolgende jaren, decennia en eeuwen naar de
voorhoede van het astronomisch onderzoek. Dit jaar is het 350
jaar geleden dat deze historische benoeming plaatsvond.

De huidige generatie Utrechtse sterrenkundigen en studenten
sterrenkunde, verenigd in het Sterrekundig Instituut Utrecht,
vieren de benoeming van hun 'oervader' middels een breed scala
aan feestelijke activiteiten. Zo is er voor scholieren een
planetenproject, programmeert de Studium Generale een aantal
voordrachten met een sterrenkundig thema en wordt op de Dies
Natalis aan een astronoom een eredoctoraat uitgereikt. Er
staat echter meer op stapel.

Studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een
sterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het
symposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het
huidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten
'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.
Bij de samenstelling van het programma is getracht de
deelnemer een zo aktueel en breed mogelijk beeld te geven van
de stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de
eerste, inleidende lezing zal dagvoorzitter prof. Lamers een
beknopt overzicht geven van de evolutie van zware sterren,
waarna de zeven overige sprekers in lezingen van telkens een
half uur nader op de specifieke evolutionaire eindprodukten
zullen ingaan. Na afloop van elke lezing is er gelegenheid tot
het stellen van vragen. Het dagprogramma staat afgedrukt op
een apart vel.
Het niveau van de lezingen is afgestemd op tweedejaars
studenten natuur- en sterrenkunde. OOK ANDERE BELANGSTELLENDEN
ZIJN VAN HARTE WELKOM!

Tijdens de lezing van prof. Kuijpers zullen, als alles goed
gaat, de veertien radioteleskopen van de Radiosterrenwacht
Westerbork worden ingezet om via een directe verbinding tussen
het heelal, Westerbork en Utrecht het zwakke radiosignaal van
een snel roterende kosmische vuurtoren, een zogeheten pulsar,
in de symposiumzaal door te geven en te audiovisualiseren.
Prof. Kuijpers zal de binnenkomende signalen (elkaar snel
opvolgende scherp gepiekte pulsen radiostraling) bespreken en
trachten te verklaren.
Het slagen van dit unieke experiment staat en valt met de
technische haalbaarheid ervan. De op te vangen signalen zijn
namelijk zo zwak, dat pas na een waarnemingsperiode van 10
miljoen jaar genoeg energie is opgevangen om een lamp van 30
Watt een seconde te laten branden! Tijdens het symposium zal
er niet zo lang gewacht hoeven te worden: de hedendaagse
technologie stelt ons in staat live het heelal te beluisteren.

Deelname aan het symposium kost f 4,- (exclusief lunch) en
f 16,- (inclusief lunch). Inschrijving geschiedt door het
verschuldigde bedrag over te maken op ABN-AMRO rekening
44.46.97.713 t.n.v. stichting 350 JUS. Het gironummer van de
ABN-AMRO bank Utrecht is 2900. Bij de inschrijving dient te
worden aangegeven of men lid is van de NNV. Na inschrijving
wordt de symposiummap toegestuurd. Bij inschrijving na
31 maart vervalt de mogelijkheid een lunch te reserveren.

Het symposium vindt plaats in Transitorium I,
Universiteit Utrecht.

At least some of what you are teaching has been demonstrated as

than good to your fellow Christians?

BTW, I used to think like Frank does.  I went to a fundamentalist
church for a while.  I didn't start to really think about what
they were saying until I noticed a ""God's Science"" phamphlet
there.  I read it and noticed that the authors of it knew virtually
nothing about Science.  I asked church members some questions about
""theories"" from the phamphlet and got only deceptive answers.  I
began to notice a very similar style of ""answers"" for theological
questions as well.  The only conclusion I could reach was that
these peoples' beliefs about the Bible were about as valid as
their beliefs in their God's Science phamphlet.

": In my mind, to say that science has its basis in values is a bit of a
: reach. Science has its basis in observable fact. 

I'd say that what one chooses to observe and how the observation is
interpreted and what significance it's given depends a great deal on
the values of the observer. Science is a human activity and as such,
is subject to the same potential for distortion as any other human
activity. The myth that scientists are above moral influence or
ethical concern, that their knowledge can be abstacted whole and pure
from nature untainted by the biases of the scientist, is nonsense.

: If one is to argue for objective values (in a moral sense) then one must
: first start by demonstrating that morality itself is objective. Considering
: the meaning of the word ""objective"" I doubt that this will ever happen.

: So, back to the original question:

: And objective morality is.....?

This may be an unfortunate choice of words, almost self-contradictory.
Objective in the sense used here means something immutable and
absolute while morality describes the behavior of some group of
people. The first term is all inclusive, the second is specific. The
concept supposedly described may have meaning however. 
If there is a God as described by the Christians (for instance), then
He has existence apart from and independent of humankind; His
existence is outside of our frame of reference (reality). If this
being declares a thing to be so, it is -necessarily- so since He has
defined Himself as omnipotent and, if His claims are to be believed,
He is at least omnipotent relative to us. God is intrinsically
self-defined and all reality is whatever He says it is - in an
objective sense.
If God determines a standard of conduct, that standard is objective.
If human beings are held accountable for their conformance to that
standard while permitted to ignore it, they substitute a relative
morality or mode of conduct, giving the term morality a nebulous,
meaningless sense that can be argued about by those pretending to
misunderstand. The standard is objective and the conduct required to
meet that standard is therefore objectively determined.
Just because it is convenient to pretend that the term morality is
infinitely malleable, doesn't mean that the objective standard itself
doesn't exist. Morality has come to mean little more than a cultural
norm, or the preferred conduct of ""decent"" people, making it seem
subjective, but it is derived from an absolute, objective, standard.
Ironically, this objective standard is in perfect accord with our true
nature (according to Christianity at least), yet is condemned as being
contrary to human nre, oppressive and severe. This may be due as",religion

"The SDIO has ""contracted"" with the NRL (Naval Research Laboratory) to fly the Clementine Mission.  BTW we call it DSPSE (Deep Space Project Science Experiment).

The NRL is building the spacecraft, designing the detailed mission and doing the

have left out...don't be mad).

I am on the TAMP (Trajectory Analysis & Mission Planning) team and am responsable
for the IV&V of the traj that Goddard/CSC are designing.

As for why SDIO is doing it, some of the reasons are:

   1)  the safety constraints are too tight to try to run the LIDAR in LEO

   2)  in LEO we don't get any new radiation data on the sensors, we will get
       that data on our 9 passages through the Van Allen (sp?) Belts

This isn't rec.guns, so maybe this is getting a bet technical, but I
can't resist....


Sometimes.....  Depends on WHY it misfired....


I can't imagine doing much combat type shooting single action.....


Assuming the cylinder WILL rotate....


Never hurts to err on the side of safety, but if you've got one of those
'new fangled' hammer blocks or transfer bar safeties, it's unnecessarily
redundant.  I'd rather have the extra round.


Quite true.  Speed loaders are a little less convenient to pack around
than magazines though.


True, but this is a training function.


Cocked and locked for single actions or hammer down on double actions
are the only carry modes that make sense...  The 80 series Colt's for
example are quite safe to carry this way.


Agreed.

Now that I've shot off my mouth a bit, let me back some of this up.  It
is true that a simple misfire on a revolver doesn't cost you much.  On
the other hand, I've had all sorts of interesting things happen over the
years.  For example, I've had FACTORY ammunition that has had high
primers.  A high primer will tie your revolver up somewhere from seconds
to minutes while you try to pound the action open to clear the problem.
An auto?  Jack the slide and continue.

I've had bullets come out of the case, keeping the cylinder from
turning, see clearing paragraph above.  About the WORST that can happen
with a semi auto is a double feed.  This can be cleared in seconds.

Most revolvers are more 'fragile' then semi auto's.  There are all sorts
of close tolerance parts and fitting involved.  Dropping the gun, or a
blow to the gun or all sorts of things can take it out of action.  Many
of the problems that can be cured on the spot with a (quality) semi auto
take a gun smith for a revolver.  In short a revolver MAY be less likely
to malfunction, but as a rule when it does, you're out of the fight.
The majority of malfunctions that occur with semi autos does not fall
into that category.

Vincint makes many good points in this post, but leaves off the opposing
view of most of them.  A real good starting place is Ayoob's ""The Semi
Auto Pistol for Police and Self Defense.""

In general, I'd agree, the revolver is an excellent first gun and self
defense weapon for somebody that does not have the time, and inclination
that is necessary for the training and practice needed to use a semi
auto effectively as a self defense arm.

Most cops are notoriously indifferent to firearms.  If the department
isn't going to train them, they aren't going to take the time on their
own.  There is no doubt that training is an issue.  The amount of
training required for effective use of a semi auto is probably several
times that of a revolver.  Many cops don't bother.

For myself, I'd hate to be limited to one or the other.  I'd rather pick
what fits better with my personal inclination, what I'm wearing that day
and so on.  Like the Moderator on rec.guns says, buy em all!

That said, I have to admit that often my advice to people thinking of
buying their first defense arm is (right after taking a class) get a
Ruger or Smith revolver....  (Sorry Colt fans.  Colt revolvers are ok
too!)

If this post had gone the other way, I'd be arguing for revolvers. :-)",politics

Rather than decide which book you want to buy, you need to decide which
programming interface you want to use, then buy the appropriate book.

I wrote an article for the X Resource which discusses the differences
between PHIGS and PEXlib (it will appear in Issue 6 which should be out
pretty soon).  But here's a brief summary...

PHIGS is a graphics API which was designed to be portable to many
devices.  Most implementations support the X Window System and take
advantage of a 3D extension to X called ""PEX"".  PEXlib is a slightly
""lower"" level API which was designed to efficiently support the PEX
extension to X.

Some advantages of using PEXlib...
- Integrates with Xlib,Xt,Motif,etc. better than PHIGS
- Provides immediate mode capabilities
- Is free of ""policy""
- PEX supports PHIGS, but is currently being extended to support
  features not found in PHIGS (like texture mapping, anti-aliasing).
  PEXlib will give you access to all of these features.

Some advantages of using PHIGS...
- Support for multiple devices, not just X based ones
- Support for archiving, metafiles, hardcopy output
- PHIGS has predefined input devices to make input easier
- PHIGS can handle exposure events and resizing for you
- PHIGS can help you with colormap selection/creation.

If you're working strictly in X and don't care about things like
archiving, I would go with PEXlib.  Either way, you will find that
both API's have a lot in common.",graphics

     Just briefly, on something that you mentioned in passing. You refer to

     not agree. So what? That is really irrelevant. We do not base our faith
     on how many people think one way or another, do we? The bottom line is
     truth, regardless of popularity of opinions.

     Also, I find it rather strange that in trying to persuade that created

     The Bible states that Lucifer was created.  The Bible states that Jesus

     The Mormon belief is that all are children of God. Literally. There is
     nothing symbolic about it. This however, contradicts what the Bible
     says. The Bible teaches that not everyone is a child of God:

          The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the 
          kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked [one];
          (Matthew 13:38)

          I speak that which I have seen with my Father: and ye do that which 
          ye have seen with your father. (John 8:38)

          Ye do the deeds of your father. Then said they to him, We be not 
          born of fornication; we have one Father, [even] God.  Jesus said 
          unto them, If God were your Father, ye would love me: for I 
          proceeded forth and came from God; neither came I of myself, but he 
          sent me.  Why do ye not understand my speech? [even] because ye 
          cannot hear my word.  Ye are of [your] father the devil, and the 
          lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the 
          beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in 
          him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a 
          liar, and the father of it. (John 8:41-44)

          And said, O full of all subtilty and all mischief, [thou] child of 
          the devil, [thou] enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease 
          to pervert the right ways of the Lord? (Acts 13:10)

          Wherein in time past ye walked according to the course of this 
          world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit 
          that now worketh in the children of disobedience: (Ephesians 2:2)

          In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the 
          devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he 
          that loveth not his brother. (1 John 3:10)

     One becomes a child of God...

          But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the
          sons of God, [even] to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)

          Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that
          we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us
          not, because it knew him not.  Beloved, now are we the sons of God,
          and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when
          he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he
          is. (1 John 3:1-2)

     ...when he is born again through faith in Jesus Christ:

          Which were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of
          the will of man, but of God. (John 1:13)

          Having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus
          Christ to himself, according to the good pleasure of his will,
          (Ephesians 1:5)

          Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we should
          be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures. (James 1:18)

          For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of
          God. For ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;
          but ye have received the Spirit of adoption, whereby we cry, Abba,
          Father. The Spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit, that we
          are the children of God: (Romans 8:14-16)

          Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and every one
          that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God. (1 John 4:7)

          Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God: and
          every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is
          begotten of him. (1 John 5:1)

     This is really a red herring. It doesn't address any issue raised, but 
     rather, it seeks to obfuscate. The fact that some groups try to read 
     something into the Bible, doesn't change what the Bible teaches. For 
     example, the fact that the Jehovah's Witnesses deny the Deity of Christ 
     does not alter what the Bible teaches [ ""Looking for that blessed hope,
     and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jesus
     Christ;"" (Titus 2:13),""Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus
     Christ, to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through
     the righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:"" (2 Peter 1:1)] 
     on the Deity of Christ.

     We first look to the Bible to see what it teaches. To discount, or not 
     even address, what the Bible teaches because there are some groups that 
     have differing views is self-defeating. To see what the Bible teaches, 
     you have to look at the Bible.

     Most of the other replies have instead hop-scotched to the issue of

"Printer model and specification:

Canon CLC 500 (Color Laser Copier)
ps-ipu unit (postscript intelligent processing unit)


Hello,

We have recently purchased a very expensive and nice color copier/printer. 
We want to be able to print to it from our SGI iris network.  The 
copier/printer has both a parallel and SCSI interface.  I have configured the
printer with the ""lp"" system using the parallel interface and can print 
postscript files to the printer.  I can also print rgb files, but these are in 
turn converted to postscript by an internal filter.  The Canon CLC 500 is a 
publication quality printer but the quality of our postscript printouts 
are less than acceptable.  We create the postscript files with a variaty of 
programs, such as showcase, xv, and tops.  When we convert to postscript 
with tops and use the -l option to specify the halftone screen density of 98 
rather than the default 40 the output is better, but still much less that 
acceptable.  Note, that we are starting with a screen image in rgb image format
and translating the image into postscript.

We suspect that if we could use the SCSI interface we would get higher quality 
pictures.  We have not purchased the software that drives the printer from the 
SCSI port.  To my knowledge this software is $5000 and does not come with a 
warranty.  The management here does not want to spend this much money without 
some assurance that the product will work.


Here my questions:

If anybody on the net uses this printer are you using the SCSI or 
parallel port?  What is the quality of the printouts?

Is there a way to create high quality postscript printouts?  What is the
limiting component, the postscript language or the postscript interpretor on 
the printer?
 
The Big question:

Where can I get some software to drive the SCSI port for this printer?

In fact, you probably want to avoid US Government anything for such a
project.  The pricetag is invariably too high, either in money or in
hassles.

The important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to
the Moon is getting into low Earth orbit.  Everything else is practically
down in the noise.  The only part of getting to the Moon that poses any
new problems, beyond what you face in low orbit, is the last 10km --
the actual landing -- and that is not immensely difficult.  Of course,
you *can* spend sagadollars (saga- is the metric prefix for beelyuns
and beelyuns) on things other than the launches, but you don't have to.

The major component of any realistic plan to go to the Moon cheaply (for
more than a brief visit, at least) is low-cost transport to Earth orbit.
For what it costs to launch one Shuttle or two Titan IVs, you can develop
a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper.  (Delta Clipper
might be a bit more expensive than this, perhaps, but there are less
ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit.)  Any plan for doing
sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting
money in a big way.

Given this, questions like whose launch facilities you use are *not* a
minor detail; they are very important to the cost of the launches, which
dominates the cost of the project.",space

"On the subject of CS/CN/tear gas: when I received my initial introduction to
tear gas, the first thing that came to mind was the location of the exit.  If
there had been anything in the way, corners to negotiate, doors to open, or 
any other obstacles to movement, I would have had a difficult time exiting the
chamber.  And any concentration of tear gas is hazardous to individuals with
respiratory problems, and the wearing of soft contact lenses in a tear gas 
contaminated area is considered a REAL BAD IDEA.  So hoping the BD's would
peaceably come strolling out the door after being gassed is a bit unrealistic.
If they could have found the door, having them staggering out retching wouldn't

That the British government advertised in American newspapers ""Send A Gun

That evidence obtained form coerced confessions is allowed in a trial.

That only serious felonies warrant a trial by jury.

[ a lot of religious opinions and quotations from the Bible and from 
many Catholic theologians and Papal Bulls ]

[ which, although introduced with a smiley, was not as funny as it
might have been (notable exception: subject headers such as ""ONE'S 
DICK IS ONE'S INSTRUMENT OF REDEMPTION."" ]

[ and indeed, the posting seemed to be more a vehicle for the
religious text than for any ""literary/moral analysis"" ]

I am surprised and saddened. I would expect this kind of behavior
from the Evangelical Born-Again Gospel-Thumping In-Your-Face We're-
The-Only-True-Christian Protestants, but I have always thought 
that Catholics behaved better than this.

Friend Dennis, I urge you to follow the example of your fellow
Catholics, of who I count many dozens as my friends, and practice
your faith through good example and decent living and respect
for the common humanity of others. Please do not stoop to the
level of the E B-A G-T I-Y-F W-T-O-T-C Protestants, who think
that the best way to witness is to be strident, intrusive, loud,
insulting and overbearingly self-righteous.

The imagery in the Song of Solomon is a little bit dated (get it? 
Middle East - date palms - oh, never mind) but apparently acceptable, 
on a steaminess level, to be accepted as part of the canon. From
this fact I derive that erotica itself is not incompatible with
Catholic doctrine.

Is there such a thing as Catholic erotica? Not necessarily a love
story between people of that faith, but a love story that is not
exploitative, does not seek redemption through penis size, pays
proper respect to the dignity of each partner, and is still erotic
enough to have a place on a.s.s.

I would submit that the _Darknites_ series of stories qualify, also
most of the _Journal Entries_, and _Rings I and II_.

I would guess that your aim is to cut down on the pornography and
increase the erotica. I actually agree with you that nearly all of
the ""I've got an enormous dick, and I shot my wad all over her face""
stories are crap. I count them as noise, which makes my take on the
signal-to-noise ration much lower than many other people's.

Since you are one of the few posters here who can actually write

Do you question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,

have decayed to dust too.  Brian, why another excuse? 


Peter wrote a bit of the Bible.  What Peter says about God is what
the Bible says.   


Consider the Bible a court recording.  Over the period of thousands of
years, various people come up and testify of their experience with the
living God.  Up comes Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up comes Moses,
once the high official of Egypt.  Up comes Elijah, a priest.  Up comes
David, a mere shepherd who became King.  Up comes the pagan King 
Nebuchanezzar.  Up comes the pagan King of Persia, Cyrus.  Up comes
Nehemiah, cupbearer to the King of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IRS agent
takes the stand.  Up comes Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use
to kill Christians for fun.  Up comes John, a 17 year old boy.  Up
comes Peter, a fishermen.  Up comes James, the brother of Jesus himself.
Up comes hundreds of others.  You hear testimony from fishermen, IRS
agents, priests, Kings.  The court hearing lasts thousands of years
with people coming up and testifying about the God who calls himself
""I am."" 

While you are listening to all this stuff, you realize that
King David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known
Matthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these
people are independent witnesses, and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet
all of the witnesses tell of the same God.   Each testifier tells
of his own experiences with the living God.  Each experience is
different, but each experience has enough cross-over to unmistakenly
reveal that each one of these people is talking about the very same God.
What Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of
Babylon, God revealed to John 600 years later--but with a different
perspective.  No two testimonies are identical.  Each testimony
dares to venture off what is already known.  Yet each witness's
testimony, even though different from those prior, consistently
describes harmoniously fitting facets of the character of the same God.  

Now.  As we stare gazing at the computer, you got this seeming fanatic
on the other end of the net, saying, I know this God  ""I am"".  He has
revealed himself to me too.  He also calls himself Jesus (John 8:58).
Please believe me.  I am telling the truth.  It is wonderful to know him.",religion

Whatever you say.  I think it's just 12 games into the season myself, so
I'm going to wait a bit before calling names.


I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher, and I have no
idea why Simmons ever wanted him.  On the other hand, I expect him to
release Otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW,
Otto's game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out
a problem with the method since Otto's performance was infinitely bad,
and excruciatingly prolonged.)


I think Merced's rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren't you willing to
give him some more at bats (and Tomlin a few more starts) before acting
so gloomy?


No he didn't.  Walk is a time bomb.  He has no stuff whatsoever, and when
the league finally realizes this, it won't be pretty at all.


Don't be so fast.  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele, which
was a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors.
Meanwhile, I'm not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a
six-year free agent before the 1992 season.


Twice through the rotation, and you've given up?  Yikes.


But so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  The useful half-life
of a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can't be much longer than a year.


But he wanted to be a Dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his
disastrous 1992.  I don't think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign
him.


He certainly wasn't last year.


Hey, that's the ""Skates Smith"" package deal.  Anybody who acquires
Lonnie for his defense or base-running (particularly at this stage) is
a real weirdo.


If that's the goal of the team ownership, than I don't see why Sauer
gets a zero for making his boss happy.  I don't know what he has or
hasn't said about revenue sharing, so I can't comment there.


It's annoying, but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them
to retain Jeff King, it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile, I think
bigger accomplishments of Simmons' tenure were getting some value for
John Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch
last year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something
in 1993.  Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement
parts, which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to
the Bucs' future.


Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case?  I
never heard the outcome of this.  When will the final verdict be in on
this?


I'm not sure who was the idiot in this case, so I don't know who to
blame.  It might have been Doug Danforth, after all.  In fact, I
*seriously* suspect it was Doug Danforth, who has shown his
willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is
pointed at his feet.

Brian K., I am pleased with your honesty.  And to be honest as well, I

Because by the things you write on the net, and the manner with which
you write them, you show me that you made up your own god and are
attempting to pass him off as the real thing.  I got news for you.
Yours doesn't at all sound like mine.  Your god doesn't come to you
because your god doesn't exist.


I am sorry Brian, but when I read your postings, I do not see an open mind.
What I do see is misunderstanding, lack of knowledge, arrogance and mockery.


Be true to yourself then.  Have an open mind.  And so end the mockery.  Gain 
knowledge of the real God.  Put your presumptions aside.  Read the
Bible and know that there is, truly is, a reason for everything and
there exists a God that has so much love for you that the depth of it goes beyond
our shallow worldly experience.  A person who commits himself  
to seeking God, will find God.  Jesus stands at your door and knocks.  But a
person who half-heartedly opens the Bible, or opens it with purpose to find 
something to mock, will find, learn and see nothing.  The only thing one
will gain with that attitude is folly.

Be careful to not jump the gun, for at first glance, there are many passages
in the Bible that will seem bizarre and absurd.  Be assured that even
though they seem alien at first, be confident that they are not.
Be assured that beyond your present comprehension, there lies such
deep reasons that once you see them, you will indeed be satisfied. 
I will personally guarantee that one.  As Jesus put it, ""You will never
be thirsty again.  Your cup will even flow over.""


From King Solomon (970 B.C. to 930 B.C.):

    ""It is the glory of God to conceal a matter;
     to search out a matter is the glory of kings.""


Jesus says in John 6:44 & 55:

   ""No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.""


And in John 3:16:

   ""For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son,
   that whosoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal
   life.""


You are included in ""whosoever"".  And I also pray that the Father is
drawing you, which it seems He is doing else you wouldn't be posting
to talk.religion.misc.  Remember Brian, you could be a St. Paul in the
making.  Paul not only mocked Christians as you do, but also had pleasure
stoning them.  Yet God showed him mercy, saved him, and Paul became
on of the most celebrated men in the history of God's church.

You see Brian, I myself better be careful and not judge you, because
you could indeed be the next Paul.  For with the fervor that you attack
Christians,  one day you might find yourself one, and like Paul,
proclaim the good news of Jesus with that very same fervor or more.

Or you could be the next Peter.  What Jesus said to Peter, Jesus would 
probably say to you: ""Satan would surely like to have you.""  Why so?
Because Peter was hard-headed, cynical and demonstrated great
moments of stupidity, but once Peter committed himself to a task
he did with full heart.  Peter was the only apostle to have the
faith to walk on water as Jesus did.

No.  The idea was suggested around here during discussions of possible
near-term commercial space activities.  One of the folks involved in those
discussions, a
spacecraft engineer named Preston Carter, passed the suggestion on to 
some entreprenurial types, and Mike Lawson is apparently going ahead with
it.  Preston is now at LLNL, and is working with Space Marketing on 
the sensors that might be carried.

Actually, that sounds unlikely.  I don't know what the launch vehicle
would be, but I would expect it to go on a commercial launcher --
certainly not on the Shuttle -- and the fraction of the cost paid to NASA
for, e.g.,  launch support would probably 
cover NASA's incremental costs pretty well.


No, as noted, LLNL is involved in lightweight sensor design, per 
Clementine and related programs.  I'm sure folks around here would like to 
see a demonstration of a modern inflatable structure, but after all, 
the U.S. did the Echo satellites long ago, and an advertising structure
would not be much closer to an inflatable space station than Echo was
(or a parade balloon, for that matter).

While I happen to personally dislike the idea, mostly because I've got
a background in astronomy, it's hardly vandalism -- it would be a short-lived
intrusion on the night sky, doing no permanent damage and actually hurting
only a small subset of astronomers.  On the other hand, it would certainly
draw attention to space.   

Which, unfortunately, this is not likely to contribute much to.


As far as I know, it's a purely commercial venture.

I gather it is being very seriously discussed with possible advertisers.
Commercial projects, however, generally don't get ""funding"" -- they
get ""customers"" -- whether it will have customers remains to be seen.

==============================================================
Hi Folks;

Wednesday marked day 2, the beginning of the trial.  Opening
statements were given by both the prosecution and the defense,
each side presenting its version of what happenned last August.

The prosecution argued that Weaver and his family moved to
Idaho in 1983 anticipating a battle with the ""evil"" federal
government.  The prosecution alleges that Weaver sold federal
agents ""sawed off"" shotguns and later failed to appear for
trial: Despite repeated ""good faith"" efforts to get Weaver
to surrender peacefully, Weaver refused.  The shootout erupted
when Weaver discovered agents on a surveillance mission and
began firing.  According to the prosecution, three people
were taking an ""offensive action"" against an FBI helicopter
when an FBI sniper killed Vicki Weaver.

The defense argued that Weaver and his family moved to northern
Idaho in 1983 to practice their religion in peace.  They wanted
simply to be left alone.  Weaver was induced by federal agents to
sell the short-barrelled shotgun (and did not, as the prosecution
alleged, want to become a ""regular supplier"").  The defense also
argued that the federal government sought to arrest Weaver when
he wouldn't become an informant [it is not specified explicitly,
but I assume that this is a reference to the white separatist
angle of the story.  We'll know more as things develop].  The
failure to appear in court happenned because Weaver was given
an incorrect court date and then indicted before that date.
The shootout occurred when federal agent Arthur Roderick killed
Weaver's dog that was in proximity to Weaver's son, Samuel.  Weaver
then fired in self-defense.  In the ensuing battle, federal
agent William Degan was killed (when his gun was later found,
there were 7 .223 cases nearby and the gun was on semi-automatic:
However, agents were near the body for an extended period of
time and could have played with the select-fire - this will
have to be more fully explained).  Finally, the defense claims
that Vicki Weaver was only going to ""look at the body"" [not recover?]
of her son when she was cut-down by an FBI sniper.

Prosecution quote: ""Weaver wanted that confrontation, and he made
that confrontation."" -- Asst. U.S. Attorney Kim Lindquist

Defense quote: ""The evidence in this case is going to show that
this is a case where Randy Weaver and Kevin Harris are charged
with crimes they didn't commit in order to cover crimes that
the government did commit.""  -- Gerry Spence  [nice soundbite!]

Notes: The _Idaho Statesman_ claims that Weaver supporters
heeded a call from Spence not to repeat yesterday's protests
outside the courthouse.  However, the local NBC affiliate
again had footage on the 10:00 news with 5 supporters including
""Tim"" again.  ""Tim"" claimed he was a skinhead, who were ""ordinary,
working class people.""  He also claimed he was for ""white pride,
not white power.""

Outside the courthouse the television crew had an impromptu interview
with Bo Gritz, who charged that the neo-nazi protestors are exactly
what the government wants to smear Randy Weaver.

In an affiliated article carried in the _Idaho Statesman_, about
a dozen lawyers were among the 70 or so people packed into the
courthouse.  These lawyers were present to watch Gerry Spence
in action, and to perhaps learn something from him.  Some
tidbits: Spence flatly told the jurors that he and his son Kent
were volunteering their time to represent Weaver because they
believed in him.  Spence, during his 90-minute opening statement,
repeatedly walked behind Weaver and placed his hands on the
defendants shoulders (Weaver broke down and cried during the
recounting of his wife's death), and Spence compared the ""sawed
off"" shotgun to driving 56 mph when the limit was 55 (another
good one!).

Today (Thursday, April 15th) the prosecution was scheduled to
begin presenting evidence.

Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for
argument's sake, define ""rushed"" as brought up to the majors for more than
a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below
expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing?  I'm serious; I
tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but
I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are
any.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can
look up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between
players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers
would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but
actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  

Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was ""rushed"", although
there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was
given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what
you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the
next year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at
age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,
and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he
would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was
performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being ""rushed"";
Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have
been less likely to give up on him.

Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  But
does that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts
performing up to expectations?",sport

Well, OBP is the most important offensive statistic, and by a big margin.
50 points of OBP is worth considerably more than 50 points of slugging.
That being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year,
but I think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find.

I personally don't care much for Alomar's defense.  I don't think he's
nearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the DP
to save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his release
is slow.  Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming
I can't overlook.  In the long term, I'd move Alomar to another position.

If the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, I'll be Alomar
could be a hell of a CF.  In the long run, I think I'd rather have Jeff
Kent at 2B and Alomar in CF than Alomar/White.

Intersection Between a Line and a Polygon (UNDECIDABLE??),
	by Dave Baraff, Tom Duff

	From: deb@charisma.graphics.cornell.edu
	Newsgroups: comp.graphics
	Keywords: P, NP, Jordan curve separation, Ursyhon Metrization Theorem
	Organization: Program of Computer Graphics


I think that this is a very difficult problem.  To start with, lines and
polygons are semi-algebraic sets which both contain uncountable number of
points.  Here are a few off-the-cuff ideas.

First, we need to check if the line and the polygon are separated.  Now, the
Jordan curve separation theorem says that the polygon divides the plane into
exactly two open (and thus non-compact) regions.  Thus, the line lies
completely inside the polygon, the line lies completely outside the polygon,
or possibly (but this will rarely happen) the line intersects the polyon.

Now, the phrasing of this question says ""if a line intersects a polygon"", so
this is a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) is
to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to
solve Q.  An answer to Q gives an answer to the original decision problem.

In recent years, many geometric problems have been successfully modeled in a
new language called PostScript.  (See ""PostScript Language"", by Adobe Systems
Incorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).

So, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that
draws the line L and the polygon P, and then ""outputs"" the answer.  By
""output"", we mean the program executes a command called ""showpage"", which
actually prints a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick
examination of the paper provides an answer to the reduced problem Q, and thus
the original problem.

There are two small problems with this approach. 

	(1) There is an infinite number of ways to encode L and P into the
	reduced problem Q.  So, we will be forced to invoke the Axiom of
	Choice (or equivalently, Zorn's Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of
	Choice is not regarded in a very serious light these days.

	(2) More importantly, the question arises as to whether or not the
	PostScript program Q will actually output a piece of paper; or in
	other words, will it halt?

	Now, PostScript is expressive enough to encode everything that a
	Turing Machine might do; thus the halting problem (for PostScript) is
	undecidable.  It is quite possible that the original problem will turn
	out to be undecidable.


I won't even begin to go into other difficulties, such as aliasing, finite
precision and running out of ink, paper or both.

The situation is not nearly as bleak as Baraff suggests (he should know
better, he's hung around The Labs for long enough).  By the well known
Dobbin-Dullman reduction (see J. Dullman & D. Dobbin, J. Comp. Obfusc.
37,ii:  pp. 33-947, lemma 17(a)) line-polygon intersection can be reduced to
Hamiltonian Circuit, without(!) the use of Grobner bases, so LPI (to coin an
acronym) is probably only NP-complete.  Besides, Turing-completeness will no
longer be a problem once our Cray-3 is delivered, since it will be able to
complete an infinite loop in 4 milliseconds (with scatter-gather.)

--------

From: deb@svax.cs.cornell.edu (David Baraff)

Well, sure its no worse than NP-complete, but that's ONLY if you restrict
yourself to the case where the line satisfies a Lipschitz condition on its
second derivative.  (I think there's an '89 SIGGRAPH paper from Caltech that
deals with this).

"I have posted a DOS MPEG decoder/player to alt.binaries.pictures.utilities.

Here is a short description and some technical information, taken from the
accompanying documentation:


                              DMPEG V1.0

                       Public Domain MPEG decoder

                           by Stefan Eckart


0. Features
===========

DMPEG/DMPLAY is another MPEG decoder/player for the PC:


 - decodes (nearly) the full MPEG video standard
   (I,P,B frames, frame size up to at least 352x240 supported)

 - saves decoded sequence in 8 or 24bit raw file for later display

 - optional on-screen display during decoding (requires VGA)

 - several dithering options: ordered dither, Floyd-Steinberg, grayscale

 - color-space selection

 - runs under DOS, 640KB RAM, no MS-Windows required

 - very compact (small code / small data models, 16 bit arithmetic)

 - real time display of the raw file by a separate player for
   VGA and many Super-VGAs

...

4. Technical information
========================

The player is a rather straightforward implementation of the MPEG spec [1].
The IDCT is based on the Chen-Wang 13 multiplication algorithm [2]
(not quite the optimum, I know). Blocks with not more than eight non-zero
coefficients use a non-separated direct multiply-accumulate 2D-IDCT
(sounds great, doesn't it?), which turned out to be faster than a 'fast'
algorithm in this (quite common) case. Dithering is pretty standard. Main
difference to the Berkeley decoder (except for the fewer number of supported
algorithms) is the use of 256 instead of 128 colors, the (default) option to
use a restricted color-space and the implementation of a color saturation
dominant ordered dither. This leads to a significantly superior quality of
the dithered image (I claim, judge yourself).

Restricted color-space means that the U and V components are clipped to
+/-0.25 (instead of +/-0.5) and the display color-space points are distributed
over this restricted space. Since the distance between color-space points
is thus reduced by a factor of two, the color resolution is doubled at the
expense of not being able to represent fully saturated colors.

Saturation dominant ordered dither is a method by which a color, lying
somewhere between the points of the display color space, is approximated
by primarily alternating between two points of constant hue instead of
constant saturation. This yields subjectivly better quality due to the
lower sensitivity of the human viewing system to saturation changes than
to hue changes (the same reasoning as used by the PAL TV standard to improve
on NTSC). The improvement is particularly visible in dark brown or redish
areas.

It should have been made fairly clear that the *most* Crimson would
ever get was a 150 (75 old style) MHz CPU upgrade.  Certainly this
was mentioned on comp.sys.sgi on more than one occasion as being
likely.  If our sales folks were saying otherwise, they were either
confused, or less than honest/ethical, or somebody further up the
chain inside SGI was misleading them.


There were 4 versions (20, 25, 30, 35), although admittedly the 30 came
out at the same time as the 35, over a period of 2 1/2 years.  The
chassis simply couldn't be pushed any further.  I'd say 4 years was
a pretty good lifespan, myself, for a system design in this day and
age.  Getting the 35 to work caused a lot of gray hairs in both the
hardware and product design groups; we would have been out of our
minds to push it further, and I *know* that was made clear, almost
from the day the 35 started shipping.  We had one last kicker in
the form of the Elan graphics, which made 3 graphics versions over
its lifespan, which I also think is pretty good.


Please, by all means send a complaint letter through SGI support
or sales on your concerns.  There should be no reason for sales folks
to misrepresent future upgrades to customers (sure, sometimes there
will be confusion for a while, over whether an upgrade will be available,
but that shouldn't last too long, and doesn't seem to be what you
are referring to).

Yes, the sales folks *do* get bonus's at the end of some (all?) quarters,
but that is pretty common industry wide, and sometimes that can result
in good deals for customers (sometimes it probably pushes folks into
systems that aren't what they need, I'm sure, but nobody is *forcing*
you to buy at end of quarter, after all...)


They don't get all that long a lead time either; although certainly
they get presentations on possible new products, and their opinions
may well influence the end product, but that also is life in the
industry.  We can't design systems that meet just their needs, or we
won't sell too many systems, after all (which is not to say that we
don't have some niche products, like Reality Engine).


But surely you don't expect a system you buy now for a five year
period to be constantly upgradable over that entire five year
period?  That's a rather unreasonable expectation, in my experience
(with workstations/microcomputers).  Supported, and parts available,
yes, but certainly not upgradable to the latest and greatest!


I missed your first posting, but as I say, by all means share your
frustation with somebody at a level inside SGI where it might
have an effect (not immediate, I'm sure, but complaints aren't
going to be ignored, and *may* affect future plans, if we 
hear similar things from more than one person/site).

   set till after launch, and suchlike. Rather than fix the code
   and possibly introduce new bugs, they just tell the crew
   'ok, if you see a warning no. 213 before liftoff, ignore it'.

Good grief. And I thought the Shuttle software was known for being
well-engineered. If this is actually the case, every member of the
programming team should be taken out and shot.

(given that I've heard the Shuttle software rated as Level 5 in
maturity, I strongly doubt that this is the case).",space
"I've been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest. I've 
transcribed some of my notes below.  Since my note taking ability is by no means
infallible, please assume that all factual errors are mine.  Permission is 
granted to copy this without restriction.

Note for newbies:  The Delta Clipper project is geared towards producing a
single staget to orbit, reusable launch vehicle.  The DC-X vehicle is a 1/3
scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in SSTO.  It is 
currently undergoing tests.  The DC-Y vehicle would be a full scale 
experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit.  It has not yet been funded.

On April 6th, Rocky Nelson of MacDonnell Douglas gave a talk entitled 
""Optimizing Techniques for Advanced Space Missions"" here at the University of
Illinois. Mr Nelson's job involves using software to simulate trajectories and
determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements.  Although he is
not directly involved with the Delta Clipper project, he has spent time with 
them recently, using his software for their applications.  He thus used 
the DC-Y project for most of his examples.  While I don't think the details
of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers (I hope
they aren't - I fell asleep during that part), I think that many of you will
be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples.

The first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit.  The
main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 Gs.  I assume that
this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints, but I
did not verify that.  The Delta Clipper Y version has 8 engines - 4 boosters
and 4 sustainers.  The boosters, which have a lower isp, are shut down in 
mid-flight.  Thus, one critical question is when to shut them down.  Mr Nelson
showed the following plot of acceleration vs time:
                  ______
3 G         /|   /      |
           / |  /       |          As ASCII graphs go, this is actually fairly 
          /  | /        |	   good.  The big difference is that the lines
2 G      /   |/         |          made by the  /  should be curves which are
        /               |          concave up.  The data is only approximate, as
       /                |          the graph wasn't up for very long.
1 G   /                 |
                        |
                        |
0 G                     |

             ^          ^
           ~100 sec    ~400 sec


As mentioned before, a critical constraint is that G levels must be kept below
3.  Initially, all eight engines are started.  As the vehicle  burns fuel the
accelleration increases.  As it gets close to 3G, the booster engines are 
throtled back.  However, they quickly become inefficient at low power, so it
soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether.  This causes the dip in 
accelleration at about 100 seconds.  Eventually the remaining sustainer engines
bring the G level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut
out entirely.

The engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit.  The trajectory is aimed
for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of
air drag slow the vehicle slightly, thus lowering the final altitude to 
that desired.

Questions from the audience:  (paraphrased)

Q:  Would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs, rather than
    all at once?

A:  Very perceptive.  Worth considering.  They have not yet done the simulation.    Shutting down all four was part of the problem as given.

Q:  So what was the final payload for this trajectory?

A:  Can't tell us.  ""Read Aviation Leak.""  He also apparently had a good 
    propulsion example, but was told not to use it.  

My question:  Does anyone know if this security is due to SDIO protecting
national security or MD protecting their own interests?

The second example was reentry simulation, from orbit to just before the pitch
up maneuver.  The biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating, and 
the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange.  He showed graphs
of heating using two different models, to show that both were very similar,
and I think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate.
The end result was that for a polar orbit landing at KSC, the DC-Y would have
about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it's reentry profile about 
60 degrees south latitude.

I would have asked about the landing maneuvers, but he didn't know about that
aspect of the flight profile.

"I have 19 (2 MB worth!) uuencode'd GIF images contain charts outlining
one of the many alternative Space Station designs being considered in
Crystal City.  Mr. Mark Holderman works down the hall from me, and can
be reached for comment at (713) 483-1317, or via e-mail at
mholderm@jscprofs.nasa.gov.

Mark proposed this design, which he calls ""Geode"" (""rough on the
outside, but a gem on the inside"") or the ""ET Strongback with
integrated hab modules and centrifuge.""  As you can see from file
geodeA.gif, it uses a Space Shuttle External Tank (ET) in place of much
of the truss which is currently part of Space Station Freedom.  The
white track on the outside of the ET is used by the Station Remonte
Manipulator System (SRMS) and by the Reaction Control System (RCS)
pod.  This allows the RCS pod to move along the track so that thrusting
can occur near the center of gravity (CG) of the Station as the mass
properties of the Station change during assembly.

The inline module design allows the Shuttle to dock more easily because
it can approach closer to the Station's CG and at a structurally strong
part of the Station.  In the current SSF design, docking forces are
limited to 400 pounds, which seriously constrains the design of the
docking system.

The ET would have a hatch installed pre-flight, with little additional
launch mass.  We've always had the ability to put an ET into orbit
(contrary to some rumors which have circulated here), but we've never
had a reason to do it, while we have had some good reasons not to
(performance penalties, control, debris generation, and eventual
de-orbit and impact footprint).  Once on-orbit, we would vent the
residual H2.  The ET insulation (SOFI) either a) erodes on-orbit from
impact with atomic Oxygen, or b) stays where it is, and we deploy a
Kevlar sheath around it to protect it and keep it from contaminating
the local space environment.  Option b) has the advantage of providing
further micrometeor protection.  The ET is incredibly strong (remember,
it supports the whole stack during launch), and could serve as the
nucleus for a much more ambitious design as budget permits.

The white module at the end of ET contains a set of Control Moment
Gyros to be used for attitude control, while the RCS will be used
for gyro desaturation.  The module also contains a de-orbit system
which can be used at the end of the Station's life to perform a
controlled de-orbit (so we don't kill any more kangaroos, like we
did with Skylab).

The centrifuge, which has the same volume as a hab module, could be
used for long-term studies of the effects of lunar or martian gravity
on humans.  The centrifuge will be used as a momentum storage device
for the whole attitude control system.  The centrifuge is mounted on
one of the modules, opposite the ET and the solar panels.

This design uses most of the existing SSF designs for electrical,
data and communication systems, getting leverage from the SSF work
done to date.

Mark proposed this design at Joe Shea's committee in Crystal City,
and he reports that he was warmly received.  However, the rumors
I hear say that a design based on a wingless Space Shuttle Orbiter
seems more likely.

Please note that this text is my interpretation of Mark's design;
you should see his notes in the GIF files.  

Instead of posting a 2 MB file to sci.space, I tried to post these for
anon-FTP in ames.arc.nasa.gov, but it was out of storage space.  I'll
let you all know when I get that done.

This is a common misconception.  There was nothing ""off the wall""
about the Wright Brothers.  They were in correspondance with a number
of other experimenters (Octave Chanute, Lillienthal, etc), they flew
models, they had a wind tunnel.  In short, they were quite mainstream
and were not regarded as odd or eccentric by the community.

I suggest you read The Bishop's Boys or the biography by Harry Gates?
Combs?  (I can never remember which it is--the guy that had the FBOs
and owned Learjet for a while).  These are both in print and easily
obtainable.  The Bishop's Boys is in trade paperback, even.

Even better would be the multi-volume set of the Wrights' writings,
but this is out of print, rare, and hideously expensive.

"Was going over some videos last night.....

Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very
interesting.  And enlightening.

Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,
circa June 1986.

1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,
    not gain more bulk.

2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's
    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.

3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like
    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is
    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -
    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his
    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,
    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard
    to make adjustments in your swing.

What would I do, if I were Jose?

Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,
so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.

First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,
and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this
will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move
the bathead more freely.

Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.

Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find
my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling
the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength
 is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of
the park.

If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back
problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could
still hit 600+ HR.

The ""face"" is an accident of light and shadow.  There are many ""faces"" in

The question of life in a more mundane sense -- bacteria or the like -- is
not quite closed, although the odds are against it, and the most that the
more orthodox exobiologists are hoping for now is fossils.

There are currently no particular plans to do any further searches for life.


Mars Observer, currently approaching Mars, will probably try to get a better

"        Well, lets see....I took a class on this last fall, and I have no
notes so I'll try to wing it...  
        Here's how I understand it. Remember from stellar evolution that 
black holes and neutron stars(pulsars) are formed from high mass stars,
M(star)=1.4M(sun).  High mass stars live fast and burn hard, taking
appoximately 10^5-10^7 years before going nova, or supernova.  In this time,
they don't live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane, so any
of these (if assumed to be the sources of GRB's) will be in the plane of the
galaxy.  
        Then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the
various satellites around the solar system, (Pioneer Venus has one, either
Pion. 10 or 11, GINGA, and of course BATSE) and we do distribution tests on our
catalog.  These tests all  show, that the bursts have an isotropic
distribution(evenly spread out in a radial direction), and they show signs of
homogeneity, i.e. they do not clump in any one direction.  So, unless we are
sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy, we are sampling the UNIVERSE.
Not cool, if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things.  Now, I
suppose you are saying, ""Well, we stil only may be sampling from inside the
disk.""  Well, not necessarily.  Remember, we have what is more or less an
interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out
to beyond Pluto(pioneer 11), so we should be able, with all of our detectors de
tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite.  Here's an 
analogy:  You see a plane overhead.  You measure the angle of the plane from
the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system.  One of your friends a mile
away sees the same plane, and measures the angle from the zero point of his
arbitrary system, which is the same as yours.  The two angles are different,
and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst, and maybe
find a source.  To my knowledge, no one has been able to do this.  
        I should throw in why halo, and corona models don't work, also.  As I
said before, looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts, (short
timescales, high energy) black holes, and pulsars exhibit much of this type of
behavior.  If this is the case, as I said before, these stars seem to be bound
to the disk of the galaxy, especially the most energetic of the these sources.
When you look at a simulated model, where the bursts are confined to the disk,
but you sample out to large distances, say 750 mpc, you should definitely see
not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction, but a clumping of sources 
in the direction of the  galactic center.  As I said before, there is none of
these characteristics.  ",space

Actually, Hiten wasn't originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all,
so it indeed didn't have much fuel on hand.  The lunar-orbit mission was
an afterthought, after Hagoromo (a tiny subsatellite deployed by Hiten
during a lunar flyby) had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion
into lunar orbit couldn't be positively confirmed.

It should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages.  It takes
a long time, and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit.
If you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit, you do have
to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel, although it is reduced from
what you'd need for the brute-force approach.",space

I hope this is a joke... if not, here's my response:

The BATF has a history of no-knock raids with poor evidence, often resulting in
innocent people being killed or suffering injury to person or property.  I will
NOT support the BATF until they clean up their act... Maybe...  As to equipment,
the BATF has damn near anything it wants...  Their faults were in intelligence
(military and civilian definitions apply), tactics (attacking during DAYLIGHT??), methodology (the FBI stated that it is against government policy to assault
a position where there are non-combatants/potential hostages without attempting
negotiations first), and legality.  The BATF's jurisdiction is TAXES on firearms
and tobacco.  They are a branch of the department of the treasury.  They have
very curiously backed away from their claims of illegal weaponry to push the
child-abuse charges... The BATF has no jurisdiction over non-firearms/tobacco
issues! And the charges of child-abuse had been investigated in the past with
no violence and no validation.  This was a clear case of first the BATF, then
the FBI, having watched too many Rambo movies...  My opinion is that the agent
in charge should be charged with executing an illegal raid, criminal negligence,
murder, civil rights violations, and breaking his/her oath to uphold and defend
the Constitution of the US.  The warrant should be unsealed to reveal to the 
public what justification the BATF thought it had in committing an armed assault
on American citizens.  And while on the issue of investigating this issue,
the Randy Weaver case and the Johnny Lawmaster case should be investigated for
BATF wrongdoing.

btw, if the BATF came busting in my windows with concussion grenades, you could damn well bet I would return fire to the utmost of my ability.

I think this is a weak argument.  The fact is, there are *two* references to
Jesus in _Antiquities of the Jews_, one of which has unquestionably at least
been altered by Christians.  Origen wrote, in the third century, that
Josephus did not recognize Jesus as the Messiah, while the long passage
says the opposite.  There is an Arabic manuscript of _Antiquities of the
Jews_ which contains a version of the passage which is much less gung-ho
for Jesus and may be authentic.
   There is no question that Origen, in the third century, saw a reference
to Jesus in Josephus.  There are no manuscripts of _Antiquities_ which
lack the references.

It is possible that it was fabricated out of whole cloth and inserted, but
I don't think it's very likely--nor do I think there is a consensus in
the scholarly community that this is the case. (I know G.A. Wells takes
this position, but that's because he takes the very small minority view
that Jesus never existed.  And he is a professor of German, not of
biblical history or New Testament or anything directly relevant to
the historicity of Jesus.)",religion

These laws written for the Israelites, God's chosen people whom God had
expressly set apart from the rest of the world.  The Israelites were a
direct witness to God's existence.  To disobey God after KNOWing that God
is real would be an outright denial of God and therefore immediately punishable.
Remember, these laws were written for a different time and applied only to 
God's chosen people.  But Jesus has changed all of that.  We are living in the
age of grace.  Sin is no longer immediately punishable by death.  There is
repentance and there is salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  And not just
for a few chosen people.  Salvation is available to everyone, Jew and Gentile

Also, you need to consider our legal system.  Since any of these things
CAN be lethal, you are going to have a hard time explaining why you applied 
lethal force when you DIDN'T think it was necessary.  (If you thought lethal
force was necessary, you wouldn't be using rubber bullets, would you?) Ouch.  
If you are justified in shooting them at all, you are justified in using 
the best self defense ammunition you can get your hands on.  It might actually
IMPROVE the legal outcome.

This is why hollow points hold up in court.  They are safer for you, safer

safer for the perp.  If you are using military hard ball, you may have to

Fred, we're all supporting what each of us thinks should be done, to some
degree.  If you have a problem with what Nick thinks should be done,
address it, instead of just complaining about his doing so.

You really don't get what the 'complaints' are about, do you?
  [not incredibly clear explanation of complaints...something between
   feelings regarding Nick's method, and judgments about his meaning]

T

F

*** Fred's issue #1;  Nick's alleged trashing of others ***

I only got it when you stopped trashing, and made your point patently,
instead of 'allegorically'.  That was my point all along, Fred.





I see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations, not
least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is
and is not debate.  Suffice to say that I disagree with you on that last
point.  Why don't you take a poll, Fred, if you want some psuedo-objective
point-of-view?

And, as usual, you defend your insults with ""he started it.""  ""Yeah, I
took some of his research and called it my own, but he started it.""  ""So
what if I stole his car, he stole my lawnmower first.""  Besides that, I
think it's still open to interpretation whether Nick actually did start it.
So your defense, besides being lame, and contradicting the first part of
the sentence in which it occurs, may not even apply anyway.

Your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool:  ""I
never borrowed it, I already gave it back, and it was broken when you
gave it to me.""  Make up yer mind, Fred!





First, I try to address what I think you meant, for which I am rewarded
with a denial of sorts, and a smart remark.  Then, I point out that I am
not clear what you did mean, rather than risking your childish ire, wrongly
interpreting you a second time, and I'm stupid for it.  I just can't win,
can I, Fred?  You've got a great point here somewhere, it's just that
between stupid people that you must insult, and your jealous guarding of
your valuable opinions, you never actually get around to making it.


*** Fred issue #2;  Nick's alleged meaning ***

Too bad the plan only exists in your mind, instead of Nick's, or you
would have a really good point.  Instead you have provided a good reason
to ignore your insults, since they are based on incorrect interpretations
that you have made about others.  Forgive me for giving your insults more
meaning than they ever should have had.

My reading of what Nick actually said is that ""people aren't required in
all parts of all space processes"", so your taking issue with his opinions
regarding people in the space program, I read as ""People are required in
all parts of all space processes.""  So, help me out, here, Fred, since I'm
so patently stupid.  Did you read Nick wrong?  Or are you going to eat
your terminal now?  If the latter, I sure hope it's one of those Cheeto and
string models that all the computer mags have been raving about :-)

The point is, _I_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption.  I'd
only be stupid if I insulted you for having made it.  But, alas, that's your
job, Fred.

And, finally, your style is confusing, since you tried to make two points,
simultaneously, with an allegory/insult.  Sadly, one point addressed a 'plan'
that only existed in your mind, and the other took issue with behaviors that
you do as much as anyone.


No, no, I finally got it.  You don't like the plan that Nick's posts made
you imagine.  And you don't like Nick's obnoxious behavior, even though
it's no worse than your own.  Thanks for taking the time with someone as
dense as myself.





Of course, Socrates.  How could it be otherwise?


Who cares who came on the net first?  If you do, consider that you saw
me come on after a brief haitus, before which I was on for about 2 years.
If you had seen me on the net first, you'd remember when Nick and I went
down exactly the same road regarding rude, unneccesary behavior.  It's
just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that's
no worse than your own.

Let's see here, my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical,
while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn't, and my
complaints about your name-calling are immature, while your name-calling
isn't.  Yeah, right.  Maybe if you called me some more names, I might
see it better, Fred.

""Net.ghod wannabe""?  Naturally, Fred, you've correctly interpreted my
motivations, when yours are impossible to judge from your actions (as
your insulting of people that try, proves).  I didn't really care about
people that fill the net with personal garbage, what I really wanted was to
impress everyone.  I only put my complaints with your behavior on private
mail, not because it belongs there, but because I thought you were such a
jerk that you'd bring it back to the Net, playing right into my hands.
Alas, I had no idea what an intellectual master you were, turning tables and
bringing the history of these posts to the net, for the noble and valuable
purpose of embarassing me.  Whether I should feel stupid because I tried
to make suggestions to such a superior intellect, or becuase I tried to
communicate like an adult with a self-righteous ass, still isn't clear.

Well, Fred, you exposed me.  Now I'll never be able to get a(nother) job
with NASA, since they all know that I'm stupider than Fred McCall.  Well,
I just hope you're happy.  Please leave me alone, now.  I just don't
have the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me.  Maybe Nick
or Pat can approach your high standards, but I'm dropping it now.

Ocean Reconnaissance Launch Surprises West
Space News, April 5-11, 1993, p.2
[Excerpts]
     Russia launched its first ocean reconnaissance satellite in 26 months 
March 30, confounding Western analysts who had proclaimed the program dead. 
     The Itar-TASS news agency announced the launch of Cosmos 2238 from 
Plesetsk Cosmodrome, but provided little description of the payload's mission. 
     However, based on the satellite's trajectory, Western observers 
identified it as a military spacecraft designed to monitor electronic 
emissions from foreign naval ships in order to track their movement. 
     Geoff Perry of the Kettering Group in England... [said]  Western 
observers had concluded that no more would be launched. But days after the 
last [such] satellite re-entered the Earth's atmosphere, Cosmos 2238 was 
launched.

Dean did not.  He called them ""the Great Commission"" but this is NOT

Matt. 10:14, Jerusalem Bible translation:

	""And if anyone does not welcome you or listen to what you have
	to say, as you walk out of the house or town shake the dust

And Dean countered:

""Actually, this comment of your's is a perfect example of what an

Of course, Matt 10:15 [quoted above] makes no mention of ""instruction
to spread the word.""

All these quotes btw are from:

Message-ID: <1993Apr13.121624.3400@cbnewsj.cb.att.com>


And I claim it correctly, because my question went:

""Do you, too, measure
the goodness of a post by its entertainment value, and care not
a whit for such mundane things as truth and falsehood?""

and the closest Dean came to an answer was:

""Peter, Peter, Peter.  You're just so stupid, pretentious, dull,
and generally unworthy of the value you place on yourself that
the sport is all there is.""

Of course, this does NOT answer my question, which has to do with posts
in GENERAL and not my posts in particular.  Surely even Dean knows this,
yet he brazenly asserts otherwise, reinforcing his claim with an insult:

""So I now restore the answer to your question
that you deleted.  If you're still unable to figure it out, ask
a nice kid at the local junior high to help you.  It really
doesn't take much sophistication to understand.""

On top of which, I doubt that the ""answer"" is at all representative
of Dean's true frame of mind.  The insults you have seen quoted thus
far are but a small sample of the stream that oozes out of Dean's 
mind throughout the 284-line post from which these quotes were taken.
One wonders whether Dean's mind is so warped as to find sport in all
this.

He even dredges up a falsified account of
events that transpired earlier on another thread:

""You made an ass of yourself by claiming that it
				^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
was in the tradition of Lent to make public announcements of
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
the ""sins"" of other individuals.""
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

False.  I said it was the tradition to recall and atone for one's sins.
That I made public announcements of the ""sins"" of others
--""sins"", BTW, that were a matter of public record, documented in
the posts of others-- is a different matter.

Many of the individuals involved are so nearly amoral that
they do not see as sins what morally upright people see as sins, so
I pointed some of them out.  And I expressly set up a whole thread,
YOUR TURN, to let people point out MY sins to me.

Dean again:

""You made an ass of yourself
by saying that my statement of the tradition of tzedukkah was
somehow an attempt to ""paint Jews as plaster saints,"" thereby
revealing your inability to understand the discussion as well
as showing your dislike for people saying positive things
about Jews, and now you show your intellectual dishonesty by
repeatedly ignoring the simple argument being made, and then
claiming I am ignoring the very argument I acknowledge.""

Actually, what happened was that Dean made it seem like ANY Jew
who gave alms or did other acts of charity in public was a hypocrite
according to Jewish customs.  In doing so, he was caricaturing
Jewish customs as being almost impossibly demanding, as well as
implicitly slandering all Jews who make public their acts of charity.

I went very easily on Dean for this, giving him the benefit of
the doubt in a post following my initial crack about ""plaster saints"", 
suggesting that he had been merely careless in his wording.

In an astonishing act of ingratitude, Dean now serves up an incredibly
distorted picture of what took place between us, and using it as
the basis of one insult after another.",religion

Who says there is no mineral rights to be given? Who says? The UN or the US
Government? 
Major question is if you decide to mine the moon or Mars, who will stop you?
The UN can't other than legal tom foolerie.. Can the truly inforce it?

If you go to the moon as declare that you are now a soverign nation, who will
stop you from doing it. Maybe not acknowledge you? 

Why can't a small company or corp or organization go an explore the great
beyond of space? what right does earth have to say what is legal and what is
not.. Maybe I am a few years ahead on this.. It is liek the old Catholic Church 
stating which was Portugals and what was Spains, and along came the Reformation
and made it all null and void.. 

What can happen is to find a nation which is acknowledged, and offer your
services as a space miner and then go mine the asteroids/mars/moon or what
ever.. As long as yur sponsor does not get in trouble..
Basically find a country who wants to go into space, but can't for soem reason
or another, but who will give you a ""home"".. Such as Saudia Arabia or
whatever..
There are nations in the World who are not part of the UN, got to them and
offer your services and such.. I know that sound crazy, but. is it..
Also once you have the means to mine the moon (or whatever) then just do it.
The UN if done right can be made to be so busy with something else, they will
not care.. 
If your worried about the US, do the same thing..

Why be limited by the short sighted people of earth.. After all they have many
other things to worry about that if someone is mining the Moon or MArs or what
ever..
Basically what I am saying is where is that drive of yeasteryears to go a
little bit farther out, to do jus ta  little bit more, and to tell the crown to
piss off.. If my ancestors thought the way many today think, Id have been born
in Central Europe just north of the Black Sea..

": : 42 is 101010 binary, and who would forget that its the

: : Of course the Question has not yet been discovered...
: ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

[ Read on and there's a special prize at the bottom.  Amaze your friends
and gain respect from your peers that you can carry on so long about the
number 42. ]

The original question was ""What is the meaning of Life, the Universe, and
and Everything.""  The answer generated by Deep Thought (the 2nd largest
computer ever created) was 42.  Deep Thought realized that to understand
the answer, one must really know what the question is.  Unfortunately, he
didn't.  But he was able to help build the largest computer (named Earth)
which could figure out the real question.  (I know this is background
knowledge for everyone here... just bear with me a sec... :)

When Arthur pulled the scrabble tiles out of the bag, he spelled out
""What is nine times six?"" (or the like).  However, it is not clear that
the monkey-man had the right question in his brain, especially since it
was that lady in the diner (which was vaporized moments later) that came
up with the answer to how everyone could get along.  On the other hand,
Marvin said he saw the answer in Dent's brain, so lets presume it's 
correct.

Well, NINE TIMES SIX ***IS*** FORTY-TWO!!!  ...in base 13.

Isn't that interesting?!  In the Jewish tradition you are incredibly
wrong!  They originate in the Torah and with Jewish ancestors,
specifically the Patriarch Abraham (z""l).  That knowledge was sent East
to India and China when Abraham gave ""gifts"" (the commentators to Jewish
scripture say this was the knowledge of the occult arts) to all the rest
of his children when he sent them away to the East.  This assured that
Isaac only, who remained with Abraham, would inherit his most important
spiritual gifts, what eventually became Judaism.

So you see, other religions can have very parochial views too.  By the
Jewish view, you are very mistaken, your scripture are not scripture,
your gods are not gods, your practices a jumble of errors that lead
people to idol worship and away from God.  That doesn't stop us from
respecting you to the extent of not trying to convert you or proselytize
you and being willing to dialog in a respectful manner.  We're content
to let you live the way you care to live as long as you leave us be.  We
are happy to co-exist as long as you give us the same right.

But your incredible rudeness and violent nature seems to preclude that.
Too bad.  Is this typical of your religion?


You are a most presumptuous fellow!  How dare you presume that the
""typical"" New Ager doesn't acknowledge God and is selfish.  What trite,
self-righteous, ego-ful garbage!  There are Buddhists, Christians, Jews,
and those of many other religions here on this newsgroups for whom your
words are simple slander.


Of course, from the Jewish perspective you are incredibly wrong.  We'd
say that there is no ""godhead"" -- just created beings who may be
enjoying a good laugh at your expense.


So not only are we selfish, we are also thieves and liars!  And you

have the Madison Common Council enact such a ban.  The campaign
committee, spearheaded by the Wisconsin Pro-Gun Movement and NRA-ILA,
relied on neighborhood canvassing, direct mail and radio/TV

he's got to tag up.  If it isn't caught, he _doesn't_ have to tag up at

a run.  If it is, he's probably headed for AAA.

I think one (not ideal) solution is to use the
tracing utility (can't remember the name, sorry!)
included in the Corel Draw s/w pack.  It can convert
bitmaps to Corel art format.  These can then be
imported into a drawing rather than the bitmap.
Result - the file is completely in Corel format and
can be SCODAL'ed no problem!

BUT the slight problem with this, which makes the
solution less than idea, is that the trace utility
spits out many more points than are necessary to
define the shapes being traced.  Straight lines and
curves are both traced as many short segments.

So... the SCODAL taking *much* longer to
image.

The obvious solution is time-consuming - stripping
out the extra points by hand using Corel.

Amusing, isn't it?  Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is
a *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.

Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom
of the 13th.  Who won the game?

-Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs.
-Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent
 defensive plays behind him to do so.
-Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and
 got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of
 the inning.

Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for
the win.

How about the offense?
-Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either
 one, the Sox would have lost in nine.
-Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single.
-Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first
 to third when...
-Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning.
-Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of
 a help, but it was something.
-Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the
 way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)

Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were
credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit
that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as
much as Richardson?

Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than
runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the
game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with
only one out!

Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You
can argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the
clutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't
*claim* to try to tell you that.

"Two developments have brought these type of activities back to
the forefront in 1993.  First, in February, the Russians deployed a
20-m reflector from a Progress vehicle after it had departed from
the Mir Space Station.  While this ""Banner"" reflector was blank,
NPO Energia was very active in reporting that future  Banner
reflectors will be available to advertisers, who could use a space-
based video of their logo or ad printed on the Banner in a TV
commercial, as filmed from the Mir.
   The second development, has been that Space Marketing Inc, the
same company responsible for merchandising space on the Conestoga
booster and COMET spacecraft, is now pushing the ""Environmental
Billboard"".  As laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the
University of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the ""Environmental
Billboard"" is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to
804x1609 meters.  Advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area,
deployed by the inflatable 'frame'.
   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for
maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ""ozone reading
sensors"" to ""continuously monitor the condition of the Earth's
delicate protective ozone layer,"" according to Mike Lawson, head of
SMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum
exposure of 30 days it will be released to re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere. According to IMI, ""as the biodegradable material burns,
it will release ozone-building components that will literally
replenish the ozone layer."" The remaining spacecraft will monitor
the atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enters and burns
up and ""adds to the ozone supply.""
   This would not be a cheap advertisement, costing at least several
millions of dollars (exact costs were not available).  But SMI
estimates that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who
watched the SuperBowl, where a 30-second advertising 'unit' cost
$600,000.  Since SMI is located in Atlanta, Georgia, it is being
promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996
Summer Olympics in Atlanta.
  
But back to Brian's questions:
  
    See above. As for serious -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my
estimate of $5-10 for development costs and a flight unit, plus
$10-15 M for a launch), then it's probably real.  They are claiming to
tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for
optimum advertising impact so they probably can't piggy back upon
someone else's planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated
launch.  That's a $10-15 M cost they need to raise, right there.
    And there will probably be some legal challenges to this as
well.  Note there is one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use
of launch vehicle advertising already.  While I don't think the
legal challenges would win out (and yes, I am an amateur astronomer,
and no, I don't really like the idea of this additional light
pollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal
challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive
aspects of the advertising.  I can imagine several ways to make the
advertisers look like louts for doing this -- which would change
positive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the
space advertising advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an
idiot?)
   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it's in a low
enough orbit, and it relies upon reflected light only, it would
only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before
dawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just
after dusk --minimizing impact on astronomy, since that's the time
of worse seeing due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still
be a problem, but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this...)
    As for having real funding -- none that I can identify.  There
were about 60 expressions of interest made on the Conestoga
advertising opportunity, but that included curious folks and was for
only a $500,000 commitment.  I haven't heard of any serious funding
for this, but I'm sure they are shopping the venture around looking
for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more.  But I
am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time.
  
   And if anybody wants to cross-post this to sci.astro, please be
my guest.  I don't have posting privileges to that area (or at least
I don't THINK I do...).

Not entirely.  Its not a premise, its a conclusion.  Second, that scientists

So do scientists, and long before you did.  Clearly you have a deep and 
fundamental misunderstanding of science.


Absolutely and utterly false (except for some were AMHs). Lucy (Australopithecus
afarensis, ca. 3 to 3.25 mya) is 40% complete, and about 80% taking into 
consideration bilateral symmetry.  Lucy walked upright and bipedally, just 
like humans, and the two share a remarkably similar dental pattern.  Her
cranial morphology is unlike humans or modern apes.  There are hundreds of 
other specimens of this and other species, of which only some are *partially* 
reconstructed.  They exist Bill.  You can touch them, feel them, hold them.  
But forget hominids.  The earth, the universe, the cultural record all look and 
test out as ancient indeed.  They are not reconstructions.  Has God has tricked
us here too?  It won't go away, Bill.
  


So *you* and other fundamentalists say.  What about the billions who don't 
say so?  Beware of people who say they have the truth, Bill, and reconsider
each time you think you do.

No.  That's *not* what I was complaining about, nor did I intend to
suggest that DEC was any better than SGI (let me tell you about the
Lynx some day, but be prepared with a large sedative if you do...).  My
comment regarding DEC was to indicate that I might be open to other vendors
that supported OpenGL, rather than deal further with SGI.

What I *am* annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that
we *would* be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the
Crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck.

I'm also annoyed about being sold *several* Personal IRISes at a
previous site on the understanding *that* architecture would be around
for a while, rather than being flushed.

Now I understand that SGI is responsible to its investors and has to
keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line (odd that I found myself
pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books
just before the end of the quarter), but I'm just a little tired of
getting boned in the process.

Maybe it's because my lab buys SGIs in onesies and twosies, so we
aren't entitled to a ""peek under the covers"" as the Big Kids (NASA,
for instance) are.  This lab, and I suspect that a lot of other labs
and organizations, doesn't have a load of money to spend on computers
every year, so we can't be out buying new systems on a regular basis.
The boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the
entire grant period of five years and, in some case, beyond.  That
means that I need to buy the best piece of equipment that I can when I
have the money, not some product that was built, to paraphrase one
previous poster's words, 'to fill a niche' to compete with some other
vendor.  I'm going to be looking at this box for the next five years.
And every time I look at it, I'm going to think about SGI and how I
could have better spent my money (actually *your* money, since we're
supported almost entirely by Federal tax dollars).

Now you'll have to pardon me while I go off and hiss and fume in a
corner somewhere and think dark, libelous thoughts.

Wrong.  Neglecting that the government and media have bullshitted the
people almost nonstop on this issue, Constitutional limitations are
there to prevent a 'tyrrany of the majority'.  For example, a majority
could vote that given ethnics have no rights, are not people, etc.
and it would fly using the logic above.

When government feels the Constitution is not right for the times,
there is a procedure called an AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION.  THis
is deliberately difficult, and cumbersome, to prevent abuse of those
who decide to ignore the people, or impose unjust policies of a
majority on a minority.   A lynch mob is a majority, remember, outvoting
the hangee.

What the government is doing are VIOLATIONS, end-runs around the
limitations on the government, probably because they know that the
people would be very hard to convince that a good intention is behind
tampering with the Bill of Rights.  Government propeganda on guns has
been very strong and persistant, but not THAT strong.  And it just
shows how gullible the people have become to ""I am from the government
and am here to help you sort of line"".  We have been lied to, fed
half truths, rigged stats, while the government knows their control
laws have no effect on crime.  They want a government monopoly on

to override Constitutional limitations by a simple vote of a bunch

  I might suggest giving the management some more mumble time by asking
the very leading question (in two or three parts)
   What are your long term expectations of space market, what projects
specifically are they funding by internal funds and at what levels
and what competition do you expect in this  area. (This last point
is always worth hitting upper management with ""gently"" if you want 
them to think and as hard as you can if you have a good case that
there really is competion)

I was under the impression that to obtain fissionable materials (i.e.,
plutonium or reactor/weapons-grade uranium) one was required to obtain
a federal permit to own such materials.


Actually, why bother looking it up?  From the material we covered last
term (in 10 weeks) of Ge/Ch 127 (Nuclear Chemistry), I could *derive*
what it would take to build a bomb.  And as far as the explosive charge,
I (as a chemist) could synthesize a variety of explosives from commonly
available chemicals in the garage if I felt like.  The electronics 
behind the detonator and the shaped charges are a little trickier,
however . . . but not impossible using a few ""tricks of the trade.""
And if I really wanted to be nasty, I could include a core of 
hydrogen and deuterium . . .

Of course, the hardest part is getting the fissionable material
to start with, and living long enough to put a bomb together.

"THE DIVINE MASTERS       
      
               Most Christians would agree, and correctly so, that 
          Jesus Christ was a Divine Master, and a projection of God 
          into the physical world, God Incarnate. 
          
               But there are some very important related facts that 
          Christians are COMPLETELY IGNORANT of, as are followers of 
          most other world religions. 
           
               First, Jesus Christ was NOT unique, John 3:16 NOTWITH-
          STANDING.  There is ALWAYS at least one such Divine Master 
          (God Incarnate) PHYSICALLY ALIVE in this world AT ALL TIMES, 
          a continuous succession THROUGHOUT HISTORY, both before and 
          after the life of Jesus. 
    
               The followers of some of these Masters founded the 
          world's major religions, usually PERVERTING the teachings of 
          their Master in the process.  Christians, for example, added 
          THREATS of ""ETERNAL DAMNATION"" in Hell, and DELETED the 
          teaching of REincarnation. 
       
               Secondly, and more importantly, after a particular 
          Master physically dies and leaves this world, there is 
          NOTHING that He can do for ANYbody except for the relatively 
          few people that He INITIATED while He was still PHYSICALLY 
          alive.  (THAT IS SIMPLY THE WAY GOD SET THINGS UP IN THE 
          UNIVERSES.)                             

               Therefore, all those Christians who worship Jesus, and 
          pray to Jesus, and expect Jesus to return and save them from 
          their sins, are only KIDDING THEMSELVES, and have allowed 
          themselves to be DUPED by a religion that was mostly 
          MANUFACTURED by the Romans. 
      
               And emotional ""feelings"" are a TOTALLY DECEIVING 
          indicator for religious validity. 
    
               These things are similarly true for followers of most 
          other major world religions, including Islam. 
     
               Thirdly, the primary function of each Master is to tune 
          His Initiates into the ""AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM"" or ""SOUND 
          CURRENT"", (referred to as ""THE WORD"" in John 1:1-5, and as 
          ""The River of Life"" in Revelation 22:1), and to personally 
          guide each of them thru the upper levels of Heaven while they 
          are still connected to their living physical bodies by a 
          ""silver cord"". 
    
               True Salvation, which completes a Soul's cycles of 
          REincarnation in the physical and psychic planes, is achieved 
          only by reaching at least the ""SOUL PLANE"", which is five 
          levels or universes above the physical universe, and this 
          canNOT be done without the help of a PHYSICALLY-Living Divine 
          Master. 
    
               One such Divine Master alive today is an American, Sri 
          Harold Klemp, the Living ""Eck"" Master or ""Mahanta"" for the 
          ""Eckankar"" organization, now headquartered in Minneapolis, 
          (P.O. Box 27300;  zip 55427). 
    
               Another Divine Master is Maharaj Gurinder Singh Ji, now 
          living in Punjab, India, and is associated with the ""Sant 
          Mat"" organization. 
      
               One of the classic books on this subject is ""THE PATH OF 
          THE MASTERS"" (Radha Soami Books, P.O. Box 242, Gardena, CA  
          90247), written in 1939 by Dr. Julian Johnson, a theologian 
          and surgeon who spent the last years of his life in India 
          studying under and closely observing the Sant Mat Master of 
          that time, Maharaj Sawan Singh Ji. 
    
               Several of the Eckankar books, including some authored 
          by Sri Paul Twitchell or Sri Harold Klemp, can be found in 
          most public and university libraries and some book stores, or 
          obtained thru inter-library loan.  The book ""ECKANKAR--THE 
          KEY TO SECRET WORLDS"", by Sri Paul Twitchell, is ANOTHER 
          classic. 
    
               Many Christians are likely to confuse the Masters with 
          the ""Anti-Christ"", which is or was to be a temporary world 
          dictator during the so-called ""last days"".  But the Masters 
          don't ever rule, even when asked or expected to do so as 
          Jesus was. 
    
               People who continue following Christianity, Islam, or 
          other orthodox religions with a physically-DEAD Master, will 
          CONTINUE on their cycles of REincarnation, between the 
          Psychic Planes and this MISERABLE physical world, until they 
          finally accept Initiation from a PHYSICALLY-LIVING Divine 
          Master. 
    
          
    
          RE-INCARNATION
          
               The book ""HERE AND HEREAFTER"", by Ruth Montgomery, 
          describes several kinds of evidence supporting REincarnation 
          as a FACT OF LIFE, including HYPNOTIC REGRESSIONS to past 
          lives [about 50% accurate; the subconscious mind sometimes 
          makes things up, especially with a bad hypnotist], 
          SPONTANEOUS RECALL (especially by young children, some of 
          whom can identify their most recent previous relatives, 
          homes, possessions, etc.), DREAM RECALL of past life experi-
          ences, DEJA VU (familiarity with a far off land while travel-
          ing there for the first time on vacation), the psychic read-
          ings of the late EDGAR CAYCE, and EVEN SUPPORTING STATEMENTS 
          FROM THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE including Matthew 17:11-13 (John the 
          Baptist was the REINCARNATION of Elias.) and John 9:1-2 (How 
          can a person POSSIBLY sin before he is born, unless he LIVED 
          BEFORE?!).  [ ALWAYS use the ""KING JAMES VERSION"".  Later 
          versions are PER-VERSIONS! ] 
          
               Strong INTERESTS, innate TALENTS, strong PHOBIAS, etc., 
          typically originate from a person's PAST LIVES.  For example, 
          a strong fear of swimming in or traveling over water usually 
          results from having DROWNED at the end of a PREVIOUS LIFE.  
          And sometimes a person will take AN IMMEDIATE DISLIKE to 
          another person being met for the first time in THIS life, 
          because of a bad encounter with him during a PREVIOUS 
          INCARNATION. 

               The teaching of REincarnation also includes the LAW OF 
          KARMA (Galatians 6:7, Revelation 13:10, etc.).  People would 
          behave much better toward each other if they knew that their 
          actions in the present will surely be reaped by them in the 
          future, or in a FUTURE INCARNATION! 



          ""2nd COMINGS""

               If a Divine Master physically dies (""translates"") 
          before a particular Initiate of His does, then when that 
          Initiate physically dies (""translates""), the Master will meet 
          him on the Astral level and take him directly to the Soul 
          Plane.  This is the ONE AND ONLY correct meaning of a 2nd 
          Coming.  It is an INDIVIDUAL experience, NOT something that 
          happens for everyone all at once.  People who are still 
          waiting for Jesus' ""2nd Coming"" are WAITING IN VAIN. 
    
          
          
          PLANES OF EXISTENCE

               The physical universe is the LOWEST of at least a DOZEN 
          major levels of existence.  Above the Physical Plane is the 
          Astral Plane, the Causal Plane, the Mental Plane, the Etheric 
          Plane (often counted as the upper part of the Mental Plane), 
          the Soul Plane, and several higher Spiritual Planes.  The 
          Soul Plane is the FIRST TRUE HEAVEN, (counting upward from 
          the Physical).  The planes between (but NOT including) the 
          Physical and Soul Planes are called the Psychic Planes. 
    
               It is likely that ESP, telepathy, astrological 
          influences, radionic effects, biological transmutations [See 
          the 1972 book with that title.], and other phenomena without 
          an apparent physical origin, result from INTERACTIONS between 
          the Psychic Planes and the Physical Plane. 
    
               The major planes are also SUB-DIVIDED.  For example, a 
          sub-plane of the Astral Plane is called ""Hades"", and the 
          Christian Hell occupies a SMALL part of it, created there 
          LESS THAN 2000 YEARS AGO by the EARLY CATHOLIC CHURCH by some 
          kind of black magic or by simply teaching its existence in a 
          THREATENING manner.  The Christian ""Heaven"" is located 
          elsewhere on the Astral Plane.  Good Christians will go there 
          for a short while and then REincarnate back to Earth. 
          
          
          
          SOUND CURRENT vs. BLIND FAITH

               The Christian religion demands of its followers an 
          extraordinary amount of BLIND FAITH backed up by little more 
          than GOOD FEELING (which is TOTALLY DECEIVING). 
       
               If a person is not HEARING some form of the ""SOUND 
          CURRENT"" (""THE WORD"", ""THE BANI"", ""THE AUDIBLE LIFE STREAM""), 
          then his cycles of REINCARNATION in this MISERABLE world WILL 
          CONTINUE. 
    
               The ""SOUND CURRENT"" manifests differently for different 
          Initiates, and can sound like a rushing wind, ocean waves on 
          the sea shore, buzzing bees, higher-pitched buzzing sound, a 
          flute, various heavenly music, or other sounds.  In Eckankar, 
          Members start hearing it near the end of their first year as 
          a Member.  This and other experiences (such as ""SOUL TRAVEL"") 
          REPLACE blind faith.

Again, you missed Jesus's point.  If you read the surrounding passages
you would understand what Jesus means by ""life in the world.""  But
as is, you bumbled around, asserted your standard axiom that the Bible is bunk,
and came up with the wrong idea.  Also, you do not know exactly
what Jesus means by eternal life.  

Brian K., do you expect to jump in the middle of the quantum mechanics
book and understand Hermite polynomials having not read the surrounding
material?  Why do you such with the Bible?  For an idea what Jesus
means by the world, look up references to it in your concordance.  For
a good description, the whole Book of Ecclesiastes is game.  For 
eternal life, check out John 17:3, John 3:15-16.  You will find that
eternal life is quite different than what you think.  Eternal life
starts NOW--an infinitely high quality of life living in fellowship
with God.



If my diety exists, you would not just cease to exist.  Jesus talks of
hell in Luke 16:19-31.  




The truth is, is that it is not some sort of magic spell.  The truth
is is that you do not understand it, and enjoy not understanding it.



Wrong again.  Christianity is supposed to be relationship.  You
do not even know what Christianity is and you are arguing against
it.

"Hello,



	I just bought a copy.  I can't disagree that it is a very good
book.  But unfortunately I was looking for the same graphics feature
described in this book but _NOT_ in 640x480x16 or 320x200x256 mode. It
is easy to accomodate all the pixel ""descriptor"" (or color attributes)
in those modes into A0000-AFFFFF, but not in 640x480x256(which is what
I am interested in).  I haven't finish the book but I affraid the
author didn't talk much about this mode(or other SVGA modes).  If
anyone out there know any good book dealing with fast SVGA graphics
manupulation(scrolling, repainting, all other good stuff..) please
send me mail.  Programming guide to SVGA card is also welcome.

	Thanks in advance.

"There is another useful method based on Least Sqyares Estimation of the sphere equation parameters.

The points (x,y,z) on a spherical surface with radius R and center (a,b,c) can be written as 

   (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2 + (z-c)^2 = R^2

This equation can be rewritten into the following form:  

   2ax + 2by + 2cz + R^2 - a^2 - b^2 -c^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2

Approximate the left hand part by   F(x,y,z) = p1.x + p2.x + p3.z + p4.1

For all datapoints, i.c. 4, determine the 4 parameters p1..p4 which minimise the average error |F(x,y,z) - x^2 - y^2 - z^2|^2.

In 'Numerical Recipes in C' can be found algorithms to solve these parameters.

The best fitting sphere will have 
- center (a,b,c) = (p1/2, p2/2, p3/2)
- radius R = sqrt(p4 + a.a + b.b + c.c).

So, at last, will this solve you sphere estination problem, at least for the most situations I think ?.",graphics

Things could be worse. A lot worse! In the mid-eighties the
teen/adult sci-fi comic 2000AD (Fleetway) produced a short story
featuring the award winning character ""Judge Dredd"". The story
focussed on an advertising agency of the future who use high powered
multi-coloured lasers/search lights pointed at the moon to paint

I've been saying that for at least 2 years now and even the A's conditioning
guru told Jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help
his back.Although I don't for one second believe Jose used steroids,his
back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience
because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame(see Jeff
Bregel ex 49er as a textbook example), and IMHO Jose is too big for his
frame.



I can't imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that
Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.



I don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with
the A's, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back
problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance
caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts
him. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're
cold, its a hitch. 


The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable
with for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses
track of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was 
clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to
me. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because
he's changed his stance so much.

I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting
all the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw
himself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous batting
practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged
bad hitting habits.

  Bill, I find it rather remarkable that you managed to zero in on what is
probably the weakest evidence.

  What is probably the most convincing is the anti-Christian literature put out
by the Jewish councils in the second century.  There are enormous quantities of
detailed arguments against Christianity, many of the arguments still being used
today.  Despite volumes of tracts attacking Christianity, not one denies the
existance of Jesus, only of his activities.

  I find this considerably more compelling than Josephus or the harmony of the
gospels (especially considering that Matthew and Luke probably used Mark as a
source).",religion

------------------------------------------------------------------
   		 NINETEENTH LETTER  

		 MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI 
A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW, Part 3       

(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 2)

   THIRD SIGN:  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW)
are extremely varied.  Because his messengership is
universal, he has been distinguished by  miracles that
relate to almost all species of creation.
    Just as the supreme aide of a renowned ruler, arriving
with many gifts in a city where various people live, will be
welcomed by a representative of each people who
acclaims him and bids him welcome in his own language
so, too, when the supreme messenger of the Monarch of
Pre- and  Post-Eternity  (Ezel and Ebed  Sultani) honored the
universe by coming as an envoy to the inhabitants of the
earth, and brought with him the light of truth and spiritual
gifts sent by the Creator of the universe and derived from
the realities of the whole universe, each species of
creation -from water, rocks, trees, animals and human
beings to the moon, sun and stars- welcomed him and
acclaimed his prophethood, each in its own language, and
each bearing one of his miracles.
    Now it would require a voluminous work to mention all
his miracles.  As the punctilious scholars have written
many volumes concerning the proofs of His prophethood,
here we will briefly point out only the general category
into which fall fhe miracles that are definite and accepted
as accurate reports.
    The evidences of the prophethood of Muhammad
(SAW) fall into two main categories:  

    The first is called irhasat and includes the paranormal 
events that happened at the time of his birth, or before his 
declaration of prophethood.  

    The second group pertains to all the remaining evidences 
of the prophethood, and contains two subdivisions: 

    1) Those wonders that were manifested after
his departure from this world in order to confirm his
prophethood, and 
	2) Those that he exhibited during the era
of his prophethood.  The latter has also two parts:  
	2.1) The evidences of his prophethood that became manifest
in his own personality, his inner and outer being, his moral
conduct and perfection, and 
    2.2) The miracles that: related to substantial matters.  
The last part again has two branches:  
	2.2.1) Those concerning the Qur'an and spirituality, and 
	2.2.2) Those relating to matter and creation.  This last 
branch is again divided into two categories:  
	2.2.2.1) The first involves the paranormal happenings 
that occured during his mission either to break the 
stubbornness of the unbelievers, or to augment the
faith of the belivers.  This category has twenty different
sorts, such as the splitting of the moon, the flowing of
water from the fingers, the satisfying of large numbers with
a little food, and the speaking of trees, rocks and animals
Each of these sons has also many instances, and thus
has, in meaning, the strength of confirmation by
consensus.  
	2.2.2.2)  As for the second category, this
includes events lying in the future that occured as he had
predicted upon Allah (SWT)'s instructions.  Now starting
from the last category, we will summarize a list of them.(1)

(1) Unfonunately, I could not write as I had intended
without choice, I wrote as my head dictated, and I could
not completely conform to the order of this classification.

Look for edge inconsistencies.  Consider two vertices, p and q, which
are connected by at least one edge.

If (p,q) is an edge, then (q,p) should *not* appear.  

If *both* (p,q) and (q,p) appear as edges, then the surface ""flips"" when
you travel across that edge.  This is bad.  

Assuming (warning...warning...warning) that you have an otherwise
acceptable surface - you can pick an edge, any edge, and traverse the
surface enforcing consistency with that edge.  

    0) pick an edge (p,q), and mark it as ""OK""
    1) for each face, F, containing this edge (if more than 2, oops)
       make sure that all edges in F are consistent (i.e., the Face
       should be [(p,q),(q,r),(r,s),(s,t),(t,p)]).  Flip those which
       are wrong. Mark all of the edges in F as ""OK"",
       and add them to a queue (check for duplicates, and especially
       inconsistencies - don't let the queue have both (p,q) and (q,p)). 
    2) remove an edge from the queue, and go to 1).

If a *marked* edge is discovered to be inconsistent, then you lose.

If step 1) finds more than one face sharing a particular edge, then you
lose. 
    
Otherwise, when done, all of the edges will be consistent.  Which means
that all of the surface normals will either point IN or OUT.  Deciding
which way is OUT is left as an exercise...

"I would like to apologize for the typos in the previous post.

In retrospect I would also like to quote another source: Douglas C.
Haldeman from his 1991 book _Homosexuality_

THERAPY INEFFECTIVE

Recently the founders of yet another prominent ""ex-gay"" ministry, Exodus
International, denounced their conversion therapy procedures as ineffective.
Michael Busse and Gary Cooper, cofounders of Exodus International and lovers
for 13 years, were involved with the organization from 1976 to 1979.  The
program was described by these men as ""ineffective . . . not one person was
healed.""  They stated that the program often exacerbated already prominent
feelings of guilt and personal failure among the counselees; many were
driven to suicidal thoughts as a result of the failed ""reparative therapy.""

The previous article quoted in the last posting is from THE ADVOCATE, June
30, 1992 called ""The Ex-Ex-Gay"" by Robert Pela.

Some personal thoughts:

It is of no great astonishment that there is a concerted effort by a major
portion of the Church to control and mandate change of a minority among
its ranks.  This was the momentum behind the Spanish Inquisition, only all
they required was a confession of faith (after much torture) and then, to
save their souls they would dispatch them to heaven through death.  Even
later, the Bible was used vigorously to defend slavery, oppression and
segragation of African-Americans, even to the justification of lynchings.
Today's scholars are just a bit more slick in their approach.  The tool is
still coersion, but now it is mostly by means of brainwashing and mind
control, convincing people that they should see themselves as less than
God sees them, then maintaining a cultic hold on them until it is felt
thier mind-conditioning is complete.  Sure, no one is ""physically"" forced
to stay in this ""reparative therapy"" but sheer social pressure is enough for
many to keep themselves in this new found bondage of self-hate.

As an abolitionist I advocate the abolishment of oppression and persecution
against gays in all facets of civil life.  A person should be judged by
the contibution, or non-contribution to the society in which they live,
not by some high-brow standard of conformity imposed by those who haven';t
a clue what is in their heart.

For those who seek more information about Gays and groups that accept them
please contact your nearest chapter of PFLAG (Parents & Friends of Lesbians
And Gays) who will be more than happy to assist you.  This is a group of
people comprised of Gays, Lesbians and Bisexuals, their parents and friends
who have formed a support group for help and understanding.  Try talking to
a parent of a gay son or daughter and learn some ""first-hand"" real life and
loving understanding.  God's love and understanding for Gay people is no
less abundant.",religion

By '8 grey level images' you mean 8 items of 1bit images?
It does work(!), but it doesn't work if you have more than 1bit
in your screen and if the screen intensity is non-linear.

With 2 bit per pixel; there could be 1*c_1 + 4*c_2 timing,
this gives 16 levels, but they are linear if screen intensity is
linear.
With 1*c_1 + 2*c_2 it works, but we have to find the best
compinations -- there's 10 levels, but 16 choises; best 10 must be
chosen. Different compinations for the same level, varies a bit, but
the levels keeps their order.

"   >Does anyone know how to size cold gas roll control thruster tanks

   Well, first you work out how much cold gas you need, then make the
   tanks big enough.

Our sounding rocket payload, with telemetry, guidance, etc. etc. and a
telescope cluster, weighs around 1100 pounds.  It uses freon jets for
steering and a pulse-width-modulated controller for alignment (ie
during our eight minutes in space, the jets are pretty much
continuously firing on a ~10% duty cycle or so...).  The jets also
need to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization, and
flip the payload around to look at the Sun.

We have two freon tanks, each holding ~5 liters of freon (I'm speaking
only from memory of the last flight).  The ground crew at WSMR choose how
much freon to use based on some black-magic algorithm.  They have
extra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack.

This should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas 
quantity.  If you really need to know, send me email and I'll try to get you
in touch with our ground crew people.

Nope - that doesn't happen.  Instead the switch (among those who

Subject: Next stand-off?
Status: R

Redwood City, CA (API) -- A tense stand-off entered its third week
today as authorities reported no progress in negotiations with
charismatic cult leader Steve Jobs.

Negotiators are uncertain of the situation inside the compound, but
some reports suggest that half of the hundreds of followers inside
have been terminated.  Others claim to be staying of their own free
will, but Jobs' persuasive manner makes this hard to confirm.

In conversations with authorities, Jobs has given conflicting
information on how heavily prepared the group is for war with the
industry.  At times, he has claimed to ""have hardware which will blow
anything else away"", while more recently he claims they have stopped
manufacturing their own.

Agents from the ATF (Apple-Taligent Forces) believe that the group is
equipped with serious hardware, including 486-caliber pieces and
possibly Canon equipment.

The siege has attracted a variety of spectators, from the curious to
other cultists.  Some have offered to intercede in negotiations,
including a young man who will identify himself only as ""Bill"" and
claims to be the ""MS-iah"".

Former members of the cult, some only recently deprogrammed, speak
hesitantly of their former lives, including being forced to work
20-hour days, and subsisting on Jolt and Twinkies.  There were
frequent lectures in which they were indoctrinated into a theory of
""interpersonal computing"" which rejects traditional roles.

Late-night vigils on Chesapeake Drive are taking their toll on
federal marshals.  Loud rock and roll, mostly Talking Heads, blares
throughout the night.  Some fear that Jobs will fulfill his own
apocalyptic prophecies, a worry reinforced when the loudspeakers
carry Jobs' own speeches -- typically beginning with a chilling ""I
want to welcome you to the 'Next World' "".",space

I'm the Virtual Reality market manager for Silicon Graphics, so perhaps I
can help a little.



Unfortunately, while SGI systems were used to create the special effects
for both Terminator 2 and Lawnmower Man, those are film-quality computer
graphics, rendered in software and written to film a frame at a time.  Each
frame of computer animation for those films took hours to render on
high-end parallel processing computer systems. Thus, that level of graphics
would be difficult, if not impossible, to acheive in real time (30 frames
per second).




It depends upon how serious you are and how advanced your application is.
True immersive visualization (VR), requires the rendering of complex visual
databases at anywhere from 20 to 60 newly rendered frames per second.  This
is a similar requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot
training. If the frame rate is too low, the user notices the stepping of
the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene, so the motion
of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous.  Thus the graphics system
must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex
data representations.

Additionally, the frame rate must be constant.  If the system renders 15
frames per second at one point, then 60 frames per second the next (perhaps
due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was
visible before), the user can get heavily distracted by the medium (the
graphics computer) rather than focusing on the data. To maintain a constant
frame rate, the system must be able to run in real-time.  UNIX in general
does not support real-time operation, but Silicon Graphics has modified the
UNIX kernel for its multi-processor systems to be able to support real-time
operation, bypassing the usual UNIX process priority-management schemes. 
Uniprocessor systems running UNIX cannot fundamentally support real-time
operation (not Sun SPARC10, not HP 700 Series systems, not IBM RS-6000, not
even SGI's uniprocessor systems like Indigo or Crimson). Only our
multiprocessor Onyx and Challenge systems support real-time operation due
to their Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP) shared-memory architecture.

From a graphics perspective, rendering complex virtual environments
requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real-time
multi-sample anti-aliasing.  Of all of the general purpose graphics systems
on the market today, only Crimson RealityEngine and Onyx RealityEngine2
systems fully support these capabilities. The anti-aliasing is particularly
important, as the crawling jagged edges of aliased polygons is an
unfortunate distraction when immersed in a virtual environment.



You can use the general purpose graphics libraries listed above to develop
VR applications, but that is starting at a pretty low level. There are
off-the- shelf software packages available to get you going much faster,
being targeted directly at the VR application developer. Some of the most
popular are (in no particular order):

	- Division Inc.		    (Redwood City, CA) - dVS
	- Sens8 Inc.		    (Sausalito, CA)    - WorldToolKit

	- Paradigm Simulation Inc.  (Dallas, TX)       - VisionWorks, AudioWorks
	- Silicon Graphics Inc.	    (Mountain View,CA) - IRIS Performer

There are some others, but not off the top of my head...

	

There are too many to list here, but here is a smattering:

He's been playing horrible defense. Baylor said after Wednesday's game that

having a rough time defensively and Jerald Clark has not been hitting.
He was true to his word; I went to Thursday's game and Gerald Young
was in right and Daryl Boston (who has a very hot bat) was in left.
Baylor was careful to say though that he didn't necessarily mean for
these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two
a shot while Clark and Bichette were not playing well.

In defense of Bichette, it looks like right field in Mile High Stadium

In Texas, you cannot carry a handgun.  Period.  Either concealed or open.
And your numbers are misleading; they include suicides and accidents.  The
real number from the Department of Public Safety:

                   Murders, Non-neg hom		Car fatalities
1991			2651			  3079
1992			2240			  3057

Texas only has ""liberal"" gun laws as far as purchasing a firearm; aside 
from that, it's probably more restrictive than most states as far as carry
goes.



The state was Virginia, and the law passed.


That right only inflicts on those who threaten my rights to life,
liberty, the pursuit of happiness, etc., in the first place.  I am not

And you wrote an *excellent* report about it.




I understand (from an unreliable source) that Canseco was considered
expendable by the A's when he refused to accept any coaching about
his batting stance.  The A's brain trust came to believe that his
back problems were exacerbated, if not caused, by having a wide open
stance, closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque
(that's a paraphrase of what I remember).

In any event, Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide
his stance, and the A's began to believe that he would either reinjure
himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power.




Apparently, you sound like LaRussa.


The A's also objected about this.

Now, unless you have an agenda against private ownership of firearms, why would
you want to harass the person trying to legally defend themselves or exercise 
their rights? (I know, defending oneself/family/whoever IS a right... at least
as far as my 9mm and I are concerned... ) (Also as far as the State of Alabama
seems to be concerned)  Why don't you push for stricter prosecution of those
who use firearms in the commission of a crime?  I've already pointed out how
we aren't nailing DUI's hard enough...  Comparing the US with other countries
seldom works, but the European attitude towards alchohol and DUI seems to work..
Their attitude towards weapons isn't really a valid comparison because they've
historically done their best to keep the populace disarmed and submissive,
while our country was founded by a bunch of rugged individualists who told the
European monarchies (for the most part) to take a flying leap (used more polite
language though).  We even weaseled out of our first international treaty, and
then convinced the French that it was in their best interests not to complain..
But first we had to overcome the fact that the Brits were doing their best to 
restrict us to squirrel guns and such, so we'd be properly submissive while
they forced us to pay for their wars.  Of course, most American history classes
these days tend to gloss over facts that do not fit the image they wish to 
convey... I'm glad my Amer. Hist. teacher was a Libertarian who had us review
a good portion of the Federalist Papers, and debate their origins and meanings.

Later on, the Andersons tried to shed their reputation as creators of some

they also aren't willing to include sufficient cancellation penalties
when they *do* decide to cut the multi-year contract and not pay on it

plans were) to make the risk acceptable of something like putting up a

Well, let me see.  UZI, no.  M-11/9, no.  M-16/AR-15, maybe.  I remember there
being a selector swtich on the AR-15.  If I remember correctly (please correct
me if I'm wrong) the switch would set to an ""off"" position or an ""on"" position
because the gun (AR-15) is semi-automatic.  Wouldn't the M-16 have a position
for semi-auto fire and full-auto fire (or maybe 3 round bursts)?  If this is
correct wouldn't it be easy to distinguish each gun by this alone?  Of course
if the AR-15 were modified to full-auto fire I wouldn't think it would be that
easy but I'm talking about distinguishing between an unmodified AR-15 and M-16.
How about the other guns?  Do they also have selector switch to switch between
semi-auto and fully-auto fire?

You're assuming that their normal rotation carries all areas of the surface
into sunlight.  Not so.  Even on Earth, each pole gets several weeks without
sunlight in mid-winter.  Pluto and Charon have much more extreme axial
tilt and a much longer orbit.  Pluto's north pole, for example, gets over
a century of darkness followed by over a century of perpetual light.

At the moment, we're in luck -- Pluto and Charon are just past their
equinox, when the Sun was just on the horizon at both poles (of each).
If we get probes there soon, only the immediate vicinity of one pole
(on each) will be in long-term shadow.  This will get steadily worse the
longer we wait.",space

Sure.  Contact the World Space Foundation.  They're listed in the sci.space
Frequently Asked Questions file, which I'll excerpt.

    WORLD SPACE FOUNDATION - has been designing and building a solar-sail
    spacecraft for longer than any similar group; many JPL employees lend
    their talents to this project. WSF also provides partial funding for the
    Palomar Sky Survey, an extremely successful search for near-Earth
    asteroids. Publishes *Foundation News* and *Foundation Astronautics
    Notebook*, each a quarterly 4-8 page newsletter. Contributing Associate,
    minimum of $15/year (but more money always welcome to support projects).

	World Space Foundation
	Post Office Box Y
	South Pasadena, California 91301

WSF put together a little paperback anthology of fiction and
nonfiction about solar sails: *Project Solar Sail*.  I think Robert
Staehle, David Brin,  or Arthur Clarke may be listed as editor.

Also there is a nontechnical book on solar sailing by Louis Friedman,
a technical one by a guy whose name escapes me (help me out, Josh),
and I would expect that Greg Matloff and Eugene Mallove have something
to say about the subject in *The Starflight Handbook*, as well as
quite a few references.


Check the following articles in *Journal of the British Interplanetary
Society*:

V36 p. 201-209 (1983)
V36 p. 483-489 (1983)
V37 p. 135-141 (1984)
V37 p. 491-494 (1984)
V38 p. 113-119 (1984)
V38 p. 133-136 (1984)

(Can you guess that Matloff visited Fermilab and gave me a bunch of
reprints? I just found the file.)

And K. Eric Drexler's paper ""High Performance Solar Sails and Related
Reflecting Devices,"" AIAA paper 79-1418, probably in a book called
*Space Manufacturing*, maybe the proceedings of the Second (?)
Conference on Space Manufacturing.  The 1979 one, at any rate.",space

"Having read the posted long article by JPFO, I have some observations:

1.  This article does NOT claim that the GCA of 1968 is a ""verbatim 
translation"" of a Nazi law.  What it says is that in another place --
the book they're talking about -- they compare the two things section
by section.  The implication is that the similarities are devastating.
In the next sentence, they talk about how in that book they reproduce 
the German text of the Nazi law, together with its translation.  Not 
surprisingly, a reader could easily conflate these two things into a 
single idea:  that the American GCA is a literal translation of the Nazi
law; and sure enough, that's what the whole thing has mutated into, 
urban-folklore style.

2.  The article goes to great pains to establish that Senator Dodd had a 
copy of the Nazi law, either from his time on the Nurnberg prosecution 
team or later.  This fact is considered highly incriminating, but I don't 
understand why.  The author repeats several times that he is simply unable 
to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text; and 
yet in a paragraph towards the end, he explains it perfectly:

""If Dodd got his copy of the original German text of the Nazi Weapons
Law during his time at Nurnberg, it likely was part of a collection of
documents, for example, issues of the Reichsgesetzblatt [the German
law registry].""

Bingo.  Exactly.  

Dodd had a *book*, with a series of Nazi laws in it, including the one
under discussion.  All of the stuff about ""Why would a U.S. congressman
have a copy of a Nazi law?"" melts away, by the author's admission.  He
then continues:  ""But if he acquired the original German text of the 
Nazi Weapons Law after his service at Nurnberg, he must have done so 
for a very specific reason...""  But there's absolutely no reason to 
think that this is the case.  In fact, as a ""senior member of the U.S. 
team that helped to prosecute Nazi war criminals"", it seems to me that
he would have *had* to have a copy.  All arguments about whether 
the Nazi Weapon Law is really of historical interest (as it obviously
is, certainly according to the author here), or whether Dodd personally
prosecuted the Interior Minister who signed it, can be put aside as red 
herrings.

3.  Having established that Dodd owned a copy of the original German text, the
JPFO article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he 
asked to have it translated.  The problem is, in the context of the charge 
levelled at Dodd, these two things work *against* each other.  People ask 
to have things translated when they *don't know what they mean*.  If Dodd 
took it upon himself to preserve the Nazi law with idea of someday introducing 
it into American law, surely by 1968 he would have know what it *meant*, 
wouldn't he?
    Anyway, this precise charge -- the main one that I questioned in an earlier
posting -- is just silly.  Why would Dodd need the exact translation for this
purpose?  Is the idea that the gun controllers, despite being presumably bent
on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil
liberties, needed a crib sheet?  Didn't they have any idea how to do it
on their own?
    Once again, the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his
own question: ""Dodd may have offered his copy of the Nazi Weapons Law
to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the 
Nazi law.""  In fact, since the law and its translation *were* entered
into the Congressional Record, under the heading of documents ""concerning
the history of Nazism and gun confiscation"", Dodd's motivation isn't a 
mystery:  he asked for the translation in order to put it in the CR.

4.  Even this article makes it clear that the part of the Nazi law that
was added *by* the Nazi regime is only a small part of that law.  
Registration of guns, for instance, was begun in 1928, and thus NOT
a ""Nazi-inspired"" idea.  The parts of the Nazi law that parallel the 
1968 GCA include handgun control of some sort, and the identification 
of certain weapons as sporting weapons.  The JPFO then goes on to list 
other parts of the Nazi law, forbidding ownership of weapons by Jews;
of course, there are no such provisions in the American GCA.  Nevertheless,
in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters, immediately after the 
discussion of the anti-Jewish parts of the law, the JPFO article continues, 
""Given the parallels between the Nazi Weapons Law and the GCA'68..."" -- so 
as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law.",politics

Well they don't export anywhere near 50% of their GNP. Mexico's perhaps
but not their own. They actually export around the 9-10% mark. Similar
to most developed countries actually. Australia exports a larger share
of GNP as does the United States (14% I think off hand. Always likely to
be out by a factor of 12 or more though) This would be immediately obvious
if you thought about it.


It is their import routes that count. They can do without exports but
they couldn't live without imports for any longer than six months if that.

the case back to the trial court because the miller court didn't

The same way that any theory is proven false.  You examine the predicitions
that the theory makes, and try to observe them.  If you don't, or if you
observe things that the theory predicts wouldn't happen, then you have some 
evidence against the theory.  If the theory can't be modified to 
incorporate the new observations, then you say that it is false.

For example, people used to believe that the earth had been created
10,000 years ago.  But, as evidence showed that predictions from this

"Archive-name: space/acronyms
Edition: 8

Acronym List for sci.astro, sci.space, and sci.space.shuttle:
Edition 8, 1992 Dec 7
Last posted: 1992 Aug 27

This list is offered as a reference for translating commonly appearing
acronyms in the space-related newsgroups.  If I forgot or botched your
favorite acronym, please let me know!  Also, if there's an acronym *not*
on this list that confuses you, drop me a line, and if I can figure
it out, I'll add it to the list.

Note that this is intended to be a reference for *frequently seen*
acronyms, and is most emphatically *not* encyclopedic.  If I incorporated
every acronym I ever saw, I'd soon run out of disk space!  :-)

The list will be posted at regular intervals, every 30 days.  All
comments regarding it are welcome; I'm reachable as bradfrd2@ncar.ucar.edu.

Note that this just tells what the acronyms stand for -- you're on your
own for figuring out what they *mean*!  Note also that the total number of
acronyms in use far exceeds what I can list; special-purpose acronyms that
are essentially always explained as they're introduced are omitted.
Further, some acronyms stand for more than one thing; as of Edition 3 of
the list, these acronyms appear on multiple lines, unless they're simply
different ways of referring to the same thing.

Thanks to everybody who's sent suggestions since the first version of
the list, and especially to Garrett A. Wollman (wollman@griffin.uvm.edu),
who is maintaining an independent list, somewhat more verbose in
character than mine, and to Daniel Fischer (dfi@specklec.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de),
who is maintaining a truly HUGE list (535 at last count) of acronyms and
terms, mostly in German (which I read, fortunately).

Special thanks this time to Ken Hollis at NASA, who sent me a copy of NASA
Reference Publication 1059 Revised: _Space Transportation System and
Associated Payloads: Glossary, Acronyms, and Abbreviations_, a truly
mammoth tome -- almost 300 pages of TLAs.

Special Bonus!  At the end of this posting, you will find a perl program
written by none other than Larry Wall, whose purpose is to scramble the
acronym list in an entertaining fashion.  Thanks, Larry!

The Japanese are still on the learning curve as far as nuclear power goes.
This means that unlike the Germans (who do great things all by themselves)
the Japanese tie up with foreign companies. The major one is Mitsubishi
(who else) who have a sharing agreement with GE I think. No chance of a
new design.


Sodium has *lots* of chemical problems. Like it eats stainless steel. Very
slowly but it gets there in the end. Not what I call a desired property.
As for design difficulties, what does sodium do there? It is a bitch and
it is only its chemical properties (flwed though they are) that means it
gets used. Two loops? That's not a design problem? Isolation from air and
water? That doesn't cause design problems? In comparison BWR's a dream rides!


Don't get none of that in a Liquid Sodium Breeder! More steel, more complexity.

"Why do spacecraft have to be shut off after funding cuts.  For
example, Why couldn't Magellan just be told to go into a ""safe""
mode and stay bobbing about Venus in a low-power-use mode and if
maybe in a few years if funding gets restored after the economy
gets better (hopefully), it could be turned on again.  

For that matter, why exactly were the Apollo lunar experiments
""turned off"" rather than just ""safed"".  Was it political (i.e.
as along as they could be used, someone would keep bugging
congress for funds)?  Turning them off keeps them pesky
scientists out of the bureaucrat's hair....  

I've heard the argument that an active but ""uncontrolled""
spacecraft causes ""radio noise.""  I find that hard to believe
that this could be a problem in a properly designed ""safe"" mode.
This safe mode could be a program routine which causes the
spacecraft to go to least fuel using orientation, and once a
(week, month, year, whatever) attempts a signal lock on Earth.
At that time, if funding has been restored, the mission can
continue.  If no signal is recieved, the spacecraft goes back to
the safe mode for another time period. As we would know when the
spacecraft is going to try to contact Earth, we could be
prepared if necessary.  

As another a spacecraft could do at the attempted contact is
beam stored data towards Earth.  If someone can receive it,
great, if not, so it's lost and no big deal.
By making the time and signal location generally known, perhaps
someone in the world might be able and willing to intercept the
data even if they're not willing to contact the spacecraft.

I see this as being particularly useful for spacecraft which
could have an otherwise long life and are in or are going to
places which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,
exiting the solar system, etc).   

Perhaps those designing future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,
etc) should consider designing in a ""pause"" mode in case their
spacecraft gets the ax sometime in the future after completion of
the primary mission. Perhaps Mars Observer and Galilleo could
have some kind of routine written in for the post mission
""drift"" phase.

So any holes in all this?

	Take a second look at ""non-toxic, non-flammable"":

		MACE (sold tothe public) is supposedly nontoxic.
		Whatthey do not tell you is that if you get mace directly
		on the linings of the lungs (such as a direct snort to
		the face) above certain quantities, it reacts similarly
		to a mustard gas inhalation.

			I know:  my father and grandfather were exposed
			to poison gas in WWI and WWII; Dad went through
			the side effects of any WEAPON, including those
			""non-toxic"" aerosols.

		WHat the label ACTUALLY means is ::

			usually, it wont kill you
			it may give you permanent CSS asthsma
			but that's better than blowing a hole in your
				head ...

		ALL aerosols are flammable IF YOU HAVE ENOUGH OXYGEN
		AND HIT IT WITH THE RIGHT IGNITER.  SOme of the most
		non-flammable substances known will BOOM or SEARFLAME
		if you hit it with the right combo.


		Let's take one:  a trash can fire.  Makes black smoke;
		already burned right?  Can't go boom, right?  Wrong.

		Suck that smoke (made up of paper that has carbonized,
		or burned about 35% of the fuel in it) into an air
		conditioning return, mix with about 5:1 air, and light
		a match.  200 feet of conduit is about the same, when
		filled with that smoke mixture, as oh, say 200 pounds TNT

			THAT is why the fire codes say NO OPEN CEILING
			TILES IN BUILDINGS.  Because 3-5 stories of
			a building have blown OUT by ""nonflammable _smoke_""

	So:
		Take a little ""nonflammable aerosol""
		Mix with gasoline or kerosene fumes

			NO electricity, remeber?  A bit of heating
			on the WACO plains?  Boil water to drink
			since the water was cut off?

		liberally mix and allow to settle for 1-4 hours

		Fumes vent down into the bus underground, and the Davidians
		move the children UPSTAIRS to a saferoom (they had one,
		armor plated, remember?) to BREATH, because kids get sick
		and die from tear gas.

		and along comes a tracer, a spark, what have you:

			everyone burns to death.

"""We"" know because the area that the gun shop/shooting range is in is right on
the border of the west side of Chicago.  That is a gang infested area.  There
are many, many bad things going on in that area.  Also, I have several friends
that live very close to that area who have had problems with some of these
folks.  By the way, where did I say that they were minorities?  Do you think
that only minorities have gangs?  Not so.  As far as the quotes are concerned
it was totally obvious that they weren't just practicing for marksmanship.  I
don't know about you but I have never seen anyone else practice marksmanship by
taking their gun out of their coat as fast as possible and start shooting.  If
you would have been there Andy it would've been obvious to you too.  Of course
it might not have been.  Who knows.  All I do know is that I was there, I live
here and I know that they were gang bangers.  When you live here long enough it
becomes pretty easy to spot them via gang colors, gang signs, etc.  One last
thing.  My sister is a social worker.  She makes it her point to find these
things out (gang signs, colors, etc) because it is in her best interest to do
so.  She is nice enough to let me know these things so I can watch out for
myself as I live right on the border of the west side of the city. Enough said.",politics
"Background: The Orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept.  It
would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft.
The idea was that you'd detonate devices with somewhere from one to
ten megatons yield behind a ""pusher plate"" attached to the main
spacecraft.  The shock wave from the explosions would transfer
momentum to the ship.

  Now, in an atmosphere I can see this.  The energy of the explosion
heats the atmosphere, which expands explosively and slams a shock wave
into the pusher plate.  But in a vacuum, only two things I can see are
going to hit the plate: fission/fusion products (barium, krypton,
helium, neutrons, evaporated bomb casing) and electromagnetic
radiation (gammas mostly, some light/heat from irradiated fission
products).

  Would this work?  I can't see the EM radiation impelling very much
momentum (especially given the mass of the pusher plate), and it seems
to me you're going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs
out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once
they're there.

  I must be missing something.  Would someone enlighten me via email?

  Thanks.

Yep, that's pretty much it. I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the
Jewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between
YHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral
Code to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries
fall, though.

As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was
required, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that
the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of
the required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).

The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between
Man and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate
anything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).


The trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the ""created
in His image"" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and
have still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if
one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors
unashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about
Jesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives
by his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.
Revelation aside, one can only ""know"" Christ second-hand or worse.

This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way
initially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible
to interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where
Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.


No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple
moral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral
code. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child
may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told
the child that it is ""wrong"". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in
the pub or bar (where there are no children). The ""wrongness"" here is if
the child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is ""inappropriate""
to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of
animals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that
he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but
you get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive
as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.

"Hi there,

I've made a VGA mode 13h graphics library available via FTP.  I originally
wrote the routines as a kind of exercise for myself, but perhaps someone
here will find them useful.  They are certainly useable as they are, but
are missing some higher-level functionality.  They're intended more as an
intro to mode 13h programming, a starting point.

*** The library assumes a 386 processor, but it is trivial to modify it
*** for a 286.  If enough people ask, I'll make the mods and re-post it as a
*** different version.

The routines are written in assembly (TASM) and are callable from C.  They
are fairly simple, but I've found them to be very fast (for my purposes,
anyway).  Routines are included to enter and exit mode 13h, define a
""virtual screen"", put and get pixels, put a pixmap (rectangular image with
no transparent spots), put a sprite (image with see-thru areas), copy
areas of the virtual screen into video memory, etc.  I've also included a
simple C routine to draw a line, as well as a C routine to load a 256
color GIF image into a buffer.  I also wrote a quick'n'dirty(tm) demo program
that bounces a bunch of sprites around behind three ""windows"".

The whole package is available on spang.camosun.bc.ca in /pub/dos/vgl.zip 
It is zipped with pkzip 2.04g

It is completely in the public domain, as far as I'm concerned.  Do with
it whatever you like.  However, it'd be nice to get credit where it's due,
and maybe an e-mail telling me you like it (if you don't like it don't bother)",graphics

  To be honest, I think the city of Houston loves the new owner.  He has
brought baseball back to Houston with key acquisitions -- players that
were from the Houston area and wanted to play for the Astros.  I don't
think that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team
as he has already admitted that he doesn't know a whole lot about baseball.
McLane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses.  He makes a valid point
that injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the
bench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid
outfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  The
pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.  We're dealing with a young
Houston team, so injuries shouldn't play a big role.  The only threat is
the bullpen -- if Jonesy goes out, we may be in trouble but with the
type of starters we have this season, there is less pressure on the pen.",sport

The gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit 'fuzzy regions'.  These
are described by the inventor as exploiting the second-order perturbations in a
three body system.  The probe was launched into this region for the
earth-moon-sun system, where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to
allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow
down. The idea is that 'natural objects sometimes get captured without
expending fuel, we'll just find the trajectory that makes it possible"". The
originator of the technique said that NASA wasn't interested, but that Japan
was because their probe was small and couldn't hold a lot of fuel for
deceleration.

that brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could 
hit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish
with .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  
leadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm 
lucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 steals
already.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I
haven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going
to use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this
year is stealing bases.

Witness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury,
or anythingelse wrong with him.  I just don't hear anything.

Looking at [1] we find that during Roman times ""Tyre vied with Sidon
for first place in the intellectual life of the period""; that Tyre was
the seat of a Christian bishop, eventually with 14 dioceses under it;
that ""the most magnificent church of its kind in all Phoenecia"" was the
basilica built in Tyre ca. 314; that Tyre was well known for its
exports of glassware, wine, white marble, and dyed cloth; that Tyre,
along with other seaports, ""provided outlets for South Arabian, Indian
and even Chinese trade""; that Tyre had to accomodate its growing
population by ""following a perpendicular, rather than horizontal, line
of growth"" (because it was running out of land to build on); that Tyre
established colonies of its own.  None of this sounds like a ""small
fishing village"" by any stretch of the imagination.

Centuries later, under the Abbasids, Tyre had ""opulent and flourishing
bazaars"" and buildings of 5-6 stories.  During this period, Tyre was
""noted for its export of sugar, beads, and, as of old, glassware.""
During the Crusades, Tyre was the second-most flourishing city held
by Franks.  (There is a lot more, but I got tired of writing.)

In [2] we read the following description of modern Lebanon: ""other
*major cities* in Lebanon include Tripoli, Sidon, Tyre, Baalbek and
Zahlah.""  [my emphasis]  This source also discusses the impact of
the Lebanese Civil War, and the Israeli military actions (1978, 1982)
on the trading ports of Tyre and Sidon.  It notes that after Israel's
withdrawel in 1984, ""Tyre appeared to enjoy a revival of its local
economy.""

If Tyre is such an insignificant little fishing village at present,
why is it always called a city (or, above, a ""major city"")?  Why
does it show up on all the maps?   When population figures for cities
in Lebanon are given, why is Tyre always one of the cities on the
list (even if the list is only a dozen cities long)?

the present_, NY, St. Martins, 1967.

country study_, edited by Thomas Collelo, 1989.


A one-horse town?  Sounds like a lot of work for one horse.
(Anyway, Tyre is connected by roads to the mainland.  They
may even use cars these days. :-) 

The 1991 Encyclopedia Britannica says ""Pop. (1982 est.) 23,000.""  
Most other references give figures in the 14-17 thousand range.
(One atlas gives the population of Tyre as 60,000; the same
source give comparatively high figures for Sidon and Beirut, also,
so I doubt that it is a typo.  Perhaps these were figures for
the cities and their surrounding areas.)  I don't doubt that the
population of Tyre has fluctuated over the last few decades.  In
particular, the 1982 Israeli military action hurt Tyre quite a bit.   


I thought you were talking about times that Tyre was destroyed.
Don't most, if not all, of these apply not just to Tyre but to 
the other cities in the area?  Sidon, for example?  Can you make
a case for Tyre having been singled out?


They had a good deal of autonomy under the Seleucids. From [2]:
Tyre ""receiv[ed] the rights [of autonomy] from Antiochus Ephiphanes
and from 125 BC onward enjoy[ed] complete autonomy. She started a
large series of coins, occasionally in gold ...""

The descriptions of Tyre under the Romans don't seem to fit
your characterization, either.  And under the Abbasids it seems
to have been allowed to flourish.  I still think you are stretching
when you try to describe Tyre as having been nothing but a small
fishing village.


A Christian apologist whose standards of scholarship are quite low.
He happens to quote the same source you quote (Nina Jidejian,
_Tyre through the Ages_, Beirut, Dar El-Mashreq Publishers, 1969).
The same sentence, in fact.  He defends the fulfillment of the

I haven't seen in print anywhere else, which is why I jumped to
the conclusion that you were quoting Josh.

Uh, right.  You also forgot that you can't get an RBI (barring a HR) with
nobody on base.  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR?

Most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the
batter did something good.  I use the phrase ""happened to be"" advisedly.
Lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the
most ability to ""turn it up a notch"" in clutch/RBI/whatever situations, and
what they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an
ability to any measurable extent.  There are no clutch hitters.  People who
tend to do things that *would* cause an RBI if there were somebody on base
end up getting RBIs proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by
being in position.  


I agree.

As the author of Multiverse, I feel I had better respond to your

few have had a few problems with their platforms - not all unix's are

useful to everyone (including you) if you were a bit more explicit! :-)

Platforms it has succesfully compiled and run on are: RS6000, Dec Ultrix

The main problem is that I don't have access to other platforms than the
RS6000, so if there are portability problems then the only way I hear

how to fix it.

As far as the software not doing anything, do you really think I would

fuzzy on the breakdown of the graphics chips and RAM/VRAM capacity).

It was demonstrated at a recent gathering at the Electronic Cafe in

"Okay, lets get the record straight on the Livermore gas gun.  
The project manager is Dr. John Hunter, and he works for the
Laser group at Livermore.  What, you may ask, does gas guns
have to do with lasers? Nothing, really, but the gun is physically
located across the road from the Free Electron Laser building,
and the FEL building has a heavily shielded control room (thick walls)
from which the gun firings are controlled.  So I suspect that the
office he works for is an administrative convenience.

I visited Hunter at the beginning of Feb. and we toured the gun.
At the time I was working on gas gun R&D at Boeing, where I work,
but I am now doing other things (helping to save the space station),

The gun uses a methane-air mixture, which is burned in a chamber
about 200 ft long by 16 inch ID (i.e. it looks like a pipe).
The chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several
hundred m/s down the chamber.  On the other side of the piston
is hudrogen gas, initially at room temperature andsome tens
of atmospheres.

The piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until
a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures, at around 50,000 psi.
The barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch
bore.  It is mounted at right angles to the chamber (i.e. they
intersect).  This was done so that in the future, the barrel
could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to
move the larger and heavier chamber.  The projectile being used
in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter
and about 50 cm long.

All of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen
gas from 50,000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the
barrel.  The barrel is evacuated, and the end is sealed with a
sheet of plastic film (a little thicker than Saran wrap).  The
plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped
in the barrel ahead of the projectile.  

The gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic
water jugs.  In the early testing fragments of the plastic
projectile were found.  At the higher speeds in later testing,
the projectile vaporizes.

The testing is into a bunker because the Livermore test range is
about 3 miles across, and the projectile would go 100-200 km
if fired for maximum range.  The intent is to move the whole gun
to Vandenberg AFB after the testing is complete, where they can
fire into the Pacific Ocean, and use the tracking radar at VAFB
to follow the projectiles.

The design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4
km/s (half of orbital speed).  So far they have reached 2 km/s,
and the gun is currently down for repairs, as on the last test
they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware (I think it
had to do with the methane-air more detonating than burning, but
I haven't had a chance to talk to Hunter directly on this).

There are people waiting to test scramjet components in this
gun by firing then out of the gun into the air (at Mach 12=
4 km/s), since the most you can get in wind tunnels is Mach 8.

This gun cost about 4 million to develop, and is basically
a proof-of-concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful-
sized payloads into space.  This would require on the order of
100 kg projectiles, which deliver on the order of 20 kg
useful payload to orbit.

Definitions:

z = the tilt of the axis of the planet away from the normal to its
orbital plane.  In case of the Earth z is about 23.5 degrees, I think.
I do not recall the exact value.  In case of Uranus, z is almost
90 degrees.

u = latitude of the location where the length of the day is measured.
Paris is at about 45 degrees.  North pole is at 90.

a = angular position of the planet around the sun.  As a goes from
0 to 360 degrees, the planet makes a full circle around the sun.
The spring equinox occurs at a=0.

L = daylight fraction = (duration of daylight)/(duration of a full day).
On the equator (u=0) L is always 1/2.  Near the north pole (u=90 degrees)
L is sometimes one and sometimes zero, depending on the time of the year.

Computation:
Define the auxiliary angles p and q by:
sin p = sin a sin z
cos q = h ( tan u tan p ),       (0 < q < 180 degrees)

Conclusion:
L = q / 180   (if q is measured in degrees)
L = q / pi    (if q is measured in radians)

Wait!  But what is h?
The cutoff function h is defined as follows:

h (s) = s    if  |s| < 1
      = 1    if   s > 1
      = -1   if   s < 1

As an interesting exercise, plot L versus a.   The graph will shows
how the length of the daylight varies with the time of the year.
Experiment with various choices of latitudes and tilt angles.
Compare the behavior of the function at locations above and below
the arctic circle.

		 MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI 
(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMAD SAW)       
(SAW: PEACE AND BLESSINGS BE UPON HIM)

In His Name (ALLAH) , Be He (ALLAH) Glorified!
There is Nothing But Glorifies His (ALLAH's) Praise.

In The Name Of  Allah, The Compassionate, The Merciful

   ""He is who has sent His Messenger with
guidance and the religion of truth  to make it
supreme over all religion:  and sufficient is Allah
as a Witness.  Muhammad is the Messenger of
Allah, and those who are with him are firm
against the unbelievers and merciful among
each other.  You will see them bowing and
prostrating  themselves, seeking Allah's grace
and His pleasure.  Their mark is on their face
the sing of prostrafion; this is their similitude in
the Torah and Indgil."" [the Our'an 48:28-29]

   Since the Nineteenth and Thirhy-first Words
concerning the mission of Muhammad (SAW) prove his
prophethood with decisive evidences, we assign the
verification of that subject to those Words.
   As a supplement to them, we will merely show here
in Nineteen Signs, some  of the flashes of that great
truth.

   FIRST SIGN:  The Owner and Master of this universe
does everything with knowledge, disposes every affair
with wisdom, directs everything all-seeingly, treats
everything all-knowingly, and arranges in everything with
His will and wisdom such causes, purposes and uses that
are apparent to us.  Since the One who creates knows,
surely the One who knows will speak, since He will
speak, surely He will speak to those who have
consciousness, thought, and speech.  Since He will speak
to those who have thought, surely He will speak to
humankind, whose make-up and awareness are more
comprehensive of all conscious beings.  Since He will
speak to humankind, surely He will speak to the most
perfect of mankind and those most worthy of address and
highest in morality, and who are qualified to guide
humanity; then He will certainly speak to Muhammad (SAW), 
who, as friend and foe alike testify, is of the highest 
character and morality, and who is obeyed by one fifth
of humanity, to whose spiritual rule half of the globe has
submitted, with the radiance of whose light has been
illumined the future of mankind for thirteen centuries, to
whom the believers, the luminous segment of humanity,
renew their oath of allegiance five times a day, for
whose happiness and peace they pray, for whom they call
down Allah's blessings and bear admiration and love in
their hearts.

   Certainly, He will speak to Muhammad (SAW),
and Indeed He has done so;  He will make him the
Messenger, and Indeed He has done so; He will make
him the guide for the rest of humanity, and Indeed He
has done so.

The impression I got from talking with Livingston was that the coming
of the Lord, power-wise, is going to be something that those who are
unprepared can't handle -- kinda like overloading a fuse -- due to 
guilt. Somehow it seems to also apply to the entire physical world as 
we know it. LF suggests that God doesn't want that and has sent Koresh 
as a reminder. 

Seems that those who have been purified through salvation, or that those
protected by the Seals, will be the ones who survive. And no -- I don't 
have a good idea yet what ""being shielded by the seals"" actually involves 
or how exactly it relates to salvation. (Other than it involves the
marriage of the Bridegroom and the Bride... for those of you Biblical
well versed.)

Me personally, I'm totally 100% dependent on God through Christ, so 
if God wants me to understand, good. If not, also good. If God wants
to save me, or dispose of me, that's great either way. Being born in
the Spirit, means being part of the Body of Christ (Ephesians 2), so
who and what I was, matters little. * What's important is loving GOD *

Come Nova, Nuke, or Apocalypse -- who cares? Satan might even be able 
to pull off a pretty convincing fake. Big deal. Not worth fearing or 
worrying about though, not before:


		   -* The Greater Glory of GOD *-
 	

Maybe Koresh is right, maybe he isn't, and it should be interesting to 
see the new message (or prophecy). The tour of the Bible I've taken in 
studying the passages he points to in the 3-02 text, has been most re-
warding. But the test of prophecy is still the fruit it bears -- which 
is not yet clear. 

Much much more important is ""Charity"" -- which by definition *is* --

       Two questions:  When was this, and do you have the relevant
numbers.  (Please note, this is *not* in any way an indication I don't
believe you or that you're not correct, but when the drop occured is
relevant.)
   

       The primary objection (beyond ones based on the ideal of
RKBA that it is simply not something the government should do) is
that it makes guns a play-thing and tool of the rich and connected.
It discriminates against the poor.

       Is self-defense considered appropriate, and if so, under what
conditions?  (Are you allowed, for instance to get a gun for protection
if you're going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular
basis or have been threatened.)


       This has been suggested in the U.S., and generally supported among
gun owners.  What many object to is that many, if not most, proposals
contain a sort of ""gotcha"" clause which allows an arbitrary denial, even
if you qualify in every way.


       At this point, it should be pointed out that in general
a driver's licence in the U.S. is for the most part nothing like its
European counterpart.  I understand getting one is far more difficult
there than here.  In the U.S. it's a joke. 

       But my usual objection is that you're discussing two different
things.  For instance, in the U.S. a driver's license is a permit
to operate a motor vehicle on a public road.  It is not necessary
to own one, or to operate it on private property.  That is, the
ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise
from the government's legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations
for behavior on public lands.  A permit to own an automobile, for instance,
which is far closer an analogy, would be a much harder thing to get
past legally, since it wouldn't be based on making regulations on public
property, but in restricting activity on private property.              


        This varies *widely*.  (One thing I think Europeans have
a difficult time with is that the U.S. has fifty unique jurisdictions,
where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different
as from one country in Europe to another).

        Some places allow open carry of both guns and knives.  Some allow
concealed.  Some prohibit both, or allow one or the other.  And it can
be either a state or local restriciton.       


       The question must be asked:  Is the right of *this* individual
affecting the rights of this *other* individual.  What we usually
get is that the rights of this *group* (meaning some individuals within
this group, here defined as ""people who own guns,"") are adversely affecting 
the rights of some other group.  

       If for instance, ""Bob"" were using his gun to attack ""Steve,"" you'd
have a point.  But essentially what we're discussing is that becuase
some person who qualifies as a member of the group ""people who own
guns"" then some third person, perhaps in another *time zone* is told
that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else's
rights.  It's like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited
by one.


       The issue is crime, violence, and murder.  The question is to
what extent guns and gun legislation impact those.


       Of course not.  It would be nice if we didn't have to fear that
other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us.
But currently we don't have that option.  Nor do I expect we will.


       No state does.  In any case, there's a limit to which the state
may enforce it's ""wisdom"" on me.  Freedom in general is an unwise
concept.  If you pre-emptively restrict everything which might be
""unwise"" then freedom becomes a meaningless concept.
   

       I'll raise my hand against driver's licenses.  As currently
implemented they're a waste of time and little more than revanue
generation for the State and ignored by a startling number of
drivers.  It does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is
necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody
else killed, or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year
old will have picked up riding around in his parents car.

       But, as I mentioned, they're two different things.

 (lots of stuff about the Nicene Creed deleted which can be read in the
  original basenote.  I will also leave it up to other LDS netters to
  take Mr. Weiss to task on using Mormon Doctrine to declare the difinitive
  word on what the LDS Church teaches as doctrine.  Hopefully the LDS 
  netters will be amiable in their explanation.)

Since it would do no good to rebut what Mr. Weiss has stated on the origin
of the Nicene Creed and its status as devine and inspired (I say ""no good""
because it cannot be proved through discussion or debate as to whether or not 
the authors of the Creed were inspired), I leave you (it will be some time 
before I post again) with the following thought authored by Eugene England, 
Professor of English at Brigham Young University.  Mr. England wrote the 
following as part of a book review section in This People's magazine (Spring 
1993 edition):

  ""I conclude with a little sermon because I believe we will not be a Mormon--
  or human--family until we can get over labeling and rejecting each other 
  with terms like feminist or patriarchal, liberal or conservative (Christian 
  or non-Christian -- Hal 8^).  When we are tempted to draw a circle around
  a set of beliefs and traditions and styles and call it American, then exclude
  those who don't fit, it may be well to consider that perhaps the most central
  defining characteristic of a good American might be ""one who doesn't draw
  exclusive circles"" -- that the surest way of excluding ourselves from the 
  central American ideal is by excluding others.  And when we are tempted to
  draw a circle around ""Mormon"" or ""Christian,"" to decide who is ""orthodox""
  and who isn't by how much they agree with us, it might be well to consider
  that the central pillar of Christ's ""orthodoxy"" is our ability to love
  unconditionally those who are different and include them in our family.

  ""I recently spent some time in a ""Christian"" bookstore in California. The
  service was excellent, the clerks and customers all smiling, neat, and
  well-scrubbed, and there were the expected wholesome offerings of scriptural
  commentaries, sentimental fiction, and collections of evangelistic sermons.
  But I was dismayed to find how much shelf space was given to attacking 
  others, often viciously---whether the political left, our modern American
  culture, or other religions.  A whole section was devoted to ""Cults and the
  Occult,"" and as you might expect, Mormonism was right there under the same
  rubric and indictment (often by the same authors) as Satanism.  And I found
  I could either rent or buy (in English or Spanish) copies of The God Makers
  (that absurdly inaccurate, even libelous, but very popular and dangerous
  anti-Mormon film that uses exaclty the same techniques and even accusations
  of the Nazi films that scapegoated Jews in the 1930s).

  ""It seems to me one major indication that a person is a genuine convert to
  Christ and his redemptive love is his lack of paranoia and anxiety (""Perfect
  love casteth out fear,"" I John 4:18).  I have always been pleased that the
  LDS Church has not engaged in attacks on other faiths, though I find a 
  disheartening increase in willingness of individual Mormons to engage in the
  same kinds of stereotyping and scapegoating---and even threats of coercive
  action---as the ""religious right wing"" has launched this year against the
  political left and American cultural and religious styles they don't like.
  It is a fearful irony that in so doing Mormons take common cause with the
  very people who have most slanderously attacked Mormons---people who would,
  if they had power, forcefully restrict Mormons' rights along with those of
  others they believe to be evil.""


The above ""sermon"" was addressed to the LDS audience who usually subscribe
to This People's magazine, but would certainly apply to all of us who
rely on the mercies and grace of Jesus Christ to bring us back into His
arms.  

Even though the LDS Church claims devine authority to exercise the principles 
of the restored gospel---as in the days of Christ, the Church does not claim 
perfection and infallibility in how those with authoritative status have or do 
now lead the Church.  I, for one, do not wish to be labelled ""Christian"", if 
those who profess themselves as Christians attack my beliefs because they are 
intollerent (for example) of the way my religion may interpret Biblical 
scriptures of the same source to have a different meaning and implication 
than mainstream Christianity would give it.  Once again, being in the 
majority does NOT in and of itself PROVE anything except that your collective 
voice is louder.  That's really all the critics of the LDS Church have to stand
on in terms of the kind of Biblical interpretation used as proof to counter 
the LDS Church' interpretation!  Using someone elses biased research of truths 
and non-truths (whose to say what the mixture is?) as an authoritative tool to 
disprove or discredit is not being fair to anyone, least of all themselves. 
Let us simply agree to disagree, and share beliefs through adult discussion 
and conversation, thereby uplifting everyone.

"Let's look at the effects of inflation on 1930's superstars' salaries.

I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good 
as it got for him.

Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know
I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)

Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if
not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.

FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)
   = $80,000 x (1.04)^65
   = just over $1,000,000.

Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.

FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65
   = almost 2,000,000.

(I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).

These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly 
overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above
average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and 
average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t 
think I'm off by much.

Unfortunately, you seem to lack the ability to rate players.  Dave
Winfield has had a better career than half the people in the Hall of
Fame.  Eddie Murray and Darrel Evans are both one of the top 100 players
of all time.  Lee Smith has had probably the greatest long career
of any relief pitcher since 1960, with the possible exception of Gossage.

On the other hand, Kingman probably isn't one of the best 750 players
of all time.

And Reardon, though a good pitcher, isn't in Smith's class career wise.



We're talking 2 of the top 50 players of all time here.  There probably
aren't 5 shortstops in history who were better than these two.


Garvey sucked.  Morris, while a very good pitcher, simply doesn't
belong near Cooperstown.

 Gee, can these guys even compare to

If Puckett and Ryan (okay, no if there) get into to the Hall, they will be 
marginal Hall of Famers (unless Puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for
a while longer)

To put this in perspective, here's a listing of the linear weights
values of the careers of the players you mention.  In parenthesis
is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it.
While no one would claim these are perfect rankings, they should give
you a good value of these guys' careers as compared to average players.

Robin Yount 43.0 (41)
Ozzie Smith 42.1 (45)
Dave Winfield 40.3 (53)
Eddie Murray 37.5 (68)
Darrel Evans 35.2 (80)
Kirby Puckett 24.3 (180)
Nolan Ryan 21.6 (219)
Jack Morris 11.8 (478)
Dave Kingman 0.4 
Steve Garvey -5.8

To give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the Hall:
Of the 71 eligible players whose career stats equaled 35.0, 64 are in the Hall
of Fame. The ones who aren't include 4 19th century players, Ron Santo, Bobby
Grich, and Bob Johnson.

Of those eligible who score between 30.0 and 34.9, 15 of 25 are in.  Of

It wouldn't impede your defense at all. There was an actual incident
in Oak Park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a

a black man used an illegally owned handgun in Oak Park to defend

not to charge the guy. Of course, pissing off anti-gun police thugs

Just want to back this up with a personal anecdote.  My grandparents
have a Navajo rug made in the 1920's, which they received in trade 
from the weaver while living in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The decorative motif
consists of 4 large black swastikas, one in each corner.  What's more, the
color scheme is black, white, and red.  To the casual glance it would
undoubtedly appear to be a Nazi relic of some kind.  Yet they owned it
ten years before Hitler and the National Socialists came to power.  

As I recall, they took it down in the 30's, and didn't feel quite right
about putting it back up until the 60's.  It still draws comments from

/If all morality were relative- big hairy deal.

As I said, you appear to be the only person saying that all morality
is relative.  Most people I know do hold some absolutes in their
moral system.

I >>personally<< believe that the dignity of the individual and the right
of free will are absolutes.  I recognize that there are some moral
systems around which don't accept this; I reject them as dangerous
and anti-social (nazism, some forms of communism, fundamentalist
xtianity--no, that's not a slam).  But for the most part, almost
every moral system agrees on these two points.

Too bad.  I know I'm right, so I get to enforce my view upon you whether

Well, then answer me this:   you seem to be opposed to moral relativism
(as you call it) because it has the capacity to degenerate.  Obviously,
then, you would advocate a nonrelative (absolute) moral system.

Whose absolutist moral system do we choose?  

How do we come to this decision?

What about people who disagree with the chosen moral system?

: The issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It
: has been whether they fired their main guns.  

Never?  This is incorrect.  Either you don't read very well or resort
to falsehoods in an attempt to make a point.

At the risk of boring and belaboring the point, my claim was
the chain was regarding the tanks ""last used in Detroit in 48"".
The text follows.

:  You did not merely claim that
: tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress
: sniper fire and that they were ""quite"" effective at this.  

Indeed, when Coffman claimed they were only used as APCs, I did say
I had been told they did fire their main guns.  
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^
: You continue to
: back away from this claim and defend something else that nobody is
: disputing.

Well, the poster who I responded to did dispute the use of tanks
post-48.  Rude of you to call Gary Coffman a nobody.  

: ""Well, it's not the main gun.""  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you
: now going to admit that you were wrong?

That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?
   --------------------------------------------------
  ""I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns
to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.""
   --------------------------------------------------

  I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're
paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own
eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps
people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,
""bullshit filters"".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.

  What was it I claimed as fact?  Here's the entire post:
  --------------------------------------------------

Correction.  I know they used tanks in Detroit 1968.  I saw em, it
was well covered in the news at that time.  Gordon Lightfoot mentions
it in his song ""Black Day in July"".
  --------------------------------------------------

  Since you don't dispute that and claim that nobody else does, that
means I was right.  

: I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67
: riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place
: without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American
: military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have
: been *big* news.

   So one would suppose.  Some folks think in happened in 48.  

Awesley goes on:
  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.

: To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion
: grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be
: perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since
: it makes your other claim seem more plausible.

John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you
have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said
nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you
need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a
while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here. 

: If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been
: screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about
: it. 

   Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an
authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it
had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an
authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged
massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.
Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but
the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was ""several"".  I've also
heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd
assert that I claimed they were truth.

: Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. 

   Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the 
difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 
years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.
So it would have been an Army cover-up.

   Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building
were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and
am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.

: If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I prefer
: to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that
: those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.

   Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe
that they did fire their guns.

   Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read
this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the
account I cited.

A few years ago a friend and I took some 256 grey-level photos from
a 1 bit Mac Plus screen using this method. Displaying all 256 levels
synchronized to the 60Hz display took about 10 seconds. After
experimenting with different aperture settings and screen
brightnesses we found a range that worked well, giving respectable
contrast. The quality of the images was pretty good. There were no
visible contrast bands.

To minimize the exposure time the display program built 255
different 1 bit frames. The first contained a dot only for pixels
that had value 255, the second only for pixels that had value 254,
etc. These frames were stored using a sparse data structure that was
very fast to 'or' onto the screen in sequence. Creating these
frames sometimes took 5-10 minutes on that old Mac, but the camera
shutter was closed during that time anyway. And yes, we wrote
directly to the screen memory. Mea culpa.

Our biggest problem was that small images were displayed in the
top left corner of the screen instead of the center. It took
an extra week to have the film developed and printed, because the
processors took the trouble to manually move the all images into
the center of the print. Who'd have guessed?",graphics

"Mr DeCenso, in spite of requiring Scholarly opinion on the hanging of Judas,
rejects that the scholarly opinion of the those scholars and then rephrases
those scholars opinion on the subject:


and 


Actually, if you do further research as to the Greek word ""apacgw,"" you will
find that it does denote success.  Those scholars did indeed have an excellent
reason to assume that the suicide was successful.  As I pointed out, I
recently checked several Lexicons:

	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Louw and Nida
	""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New Testament""
	""Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament,"" Grimm
	""Word study Concordance,"" Tynsdale
	""A Greek English Lexicon of the New Testament and other 
	 early Christian Writings,"" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich
	""The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,"" Perschbacher

A couple simply stated ""hanged oneself"", and a couple were more explicit 
and stated that ""apacgw"" means specifically ""kill yourself by hanging."" A
couple also noted that the meaning of one the root words for ""apacgw"" is
""strangle, throttle or choke"" (which pretty much invalidates the guy who
suggested to David Joslin that Judas was hung upside down).  One of the best
references though, ""Robinson's Greek and English Lexicon of the New
Testament,"" not only stated the translation, it gave both the root words, the
literal translation, related greek words which use the same roots, and also
other presented specific examples of the word in greek literature (to give
further context).  

The word ""apagchw"" has two root words: ""gchw"" is the ""to strangle"" root, and
the root word ""apo"" means literally ""away."" This root words is included in
words which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the
greek word ""apagello"" means to send a message).  ""Apo"" can also denote a
change in state and specifically the change from life to death.  Robinson
specifically makes comparison to the word ""apokteiuo,"" which means ""to kill.""
In literal meaning the word ""apacgw"" means ""to throttle, strangle to put out
of the way,"" and implicitly denotes a change in life state (ie: away from
life, to death).  So while the word ""apacgw"" does mean ""to hang,"" it
specifically denotes a death as well.  Thus Robinson is quite specific when he
state that it means ""to hang oneself, to end one's life by hanging."" He then
notes the the use of ""apacgw"" in Homers Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He
presents that example of ""apacgw"" as being used to explicitly mean ""suicide by
hanging."" Now since there is a perfectly good word for strangling, without the
added denotation of ""death,"" and as you insist that the Bible was written by
God, and every word is precicely correct, you are stuck with the complete
meaning of ""apacgw"" (ie: Since the word ""apacgw"" was used, then death is
denoted as the result). 

By the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also presents an example of ""apacgw"":


Note Mr DeCenso, as you say, the Septuagint was a translation from Hebrew to
Greek, and you have not shown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie"" the the
Hebrew say ""and died""), and thus whether it was simply echoed in the Greek. 
It should also be pointed out that, regardless of the added ""and died"", the
correct translation would still be ""apacgw,"" as the man did indeed die from
strangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the
Septuagint was repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included versions
which contradicted each other), and such editing was not even necessarily
executed by Greeks.  Thus I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint as it
now stands, as a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove
your point Mr DeCenso, is an example, in ancient greek, of someone committing
""apacgw"" and surviving.  Otherwise I would see you as simply making worthless
assertions without corresponding evidence. 

Now I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it
one of your apparently contrived exegisis, I pretty much find it false.  Thus,
I think that if you are going to add to the text, something over and above
what the source clearly says, then you had better have an explicit Greek or
historical source to justify it. 

By the way, as to Mr Rose's statement about trees around the Potter's Field:


Unless Mr Rose can show that these trees are two thousand years old, or that
there are 2000 year old stumps there, or has a 2 thousand year old description
of the area which mentions such trees, then it is inappropriate for him to
assert that the present placement of trees prove the location of the trees two
thousand years ago (after all, things change). 

Now as to your other argument, ie: that the money Judas used is not the same
as the 30 silvers:


True, Peter (or the author of Acts) does not specifically call Judas' betrayal
""an iniquity,"" but for that matter, neither does John specifically call Judas'
actions ""an iniquity"" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Judas took

    ""Some thought that because, Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling
     him ""Buy what we need for the feast""; or that he should give something
     to the poor, So after receiving the morsel he immediately went out, and
     it was night.""

Note that it is said that Judas left, it does not say that he took the money
box.  Thus when I see your explanation it still seems to me you would choose
the a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different
book, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by
the author of acts.  I find this forced and contrived. 

Of course this particular argument becomes moot, since we have have seen
evidence that ""apacgw"" means suicide.  You see, since Judas' hanging was
successful, he could not have spent the money mentioned in John 13:29, because
Matthew and Mark explicitly say the betrayal was on the high holy day (ie:
Passover), and thus he could not have spent the money before killing himself
the next day.  Thus the money which bought the ""Field of Blood"" would have to
have been the 30 pieces of silver (Of course he got the 30 pieces of silver
that night as well, and thus couldn't have spent that either.  Oh dear, I
believe that the house of cards is comming down). 

Maybe we should at this point, discuss now whether Jesus was crucified on
Friday or Saturday as that is now part of the argument about Judas.

By the way, as to where the prophesy of the Potter's field came from (ie: the
mention of it in Matthew), you say:


I am reminding you now to discuss it now. It's all part of the same verse we

is not nearly as airtight as they thought.  I hope to do that with
this list.

Specifically: when I bring up the fact that Genesis contains two
contradictory creation stories, I usually get blank stares or flat
denials.  I've never had a fundamentalist acknowledge that there are
indeed two different accounts of creation.

What's ""loosing?""  


I vote.  I don't consider RKBA an abomination. 


I'm sure Sarah Brady would be delighted to hear your ranting and
raving.  However, Clinton has not publically stated that he would
like to repeal the Second Amendment.  ""Tough titty"" to you.


Are we going to ""make do without"" like the people in New York City? 
You know New York City: That gun ban utopia you dream about, with
the millions of unregistered handguns?  New York City, by the way,
has a very high crime rate.

Perhaps you should know about a gungrabber's nightmare - Idaho.
Here in Idaho, the police give concealed carry permits to anyone
over 21 without a criminal record.  There are no gungrabber schemes
such as FOIDs, waiting periods, ""gun a month,"" or LTCs.  And horror
of horrors!  You don't even NEED a permit to carry a concealed
weapon while outside of city limits (although you do need a permit
for concealed carry in an automobile).

I feel a hell of a lot safer in Boise than I would in your gun ban
dream state (e.g., Washington, D.C.).


The voting public in Idaho is staunchly pro-gun.  Both senators
are NRA-endorsed ""A"" rated!  Buy a clue, pal.

Get out your wallet and buy another clue.  There are millions upon
MILLIONS of pre-1968 (i.e., non-4473'ed) firearms out there.
They have a half-life approaching eternity.  And cosmoline is not
exactly tracked by the feds.

Gun control laws were passed to PROTECT the KKK from blacks!

"From another space forum
    When workers at the Kennedy Space Center disassembled the STS-56
 solid rocket boosters they were surprised to find a pair of pliers
 lodged into the outside base of the right hand SRB.  The tool survived
 the trip from the launch pad up to approximately a 250,000 foot
 altitude, then down to splashdown and towing back to KSC.

    NASA spokesperson Lisa Malone told the media,

    ""It's been a long time since something like this happened.  We've
 lost washers and bolts (before) but never a tool like this.""

    The initial investigation into the incident has shown that a
 Thiokol Corp. technician noticed and reported his pliers as missing on
 April 2nd.  Unfortunately, the worker's supervisor did not act on the
 report and Discovery was launched with its ""extra payload"".  NASA
 officials were never told of the missing tool before the April 8th
 launch date.

    The free-flying pliers were supposed to be tethered to the SRB
 technician.  When the tool was found in an aft section of the booster,
 its 18-inch long rope was still attached.  The pliers were found in a
 part of the booster which is not easily visible from the launch pad.

    A spokesperson for the Lockheed Space Operations Company said that
 the Shuttle processor will take ""appropriate action"".  Thiokol is a
 subcontractor to LSOC for work to prepare Shuttle hardware for launch.

Every aircraft has flight constraints for speed/AOA/power.  When
graphed, these define the 'flight envelope' of that aircraft,
presumably so named because the graphed line encloses (envelopes) the
area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft
doesn't fall out of the sky.  Hence, 'pushing the envelope' becomes
'operating at (or beyond) the edge of the flight (or operational)
envelope'. 

Note that the envelope isn't precisely known until someone actually
flies the airplane in those regions -- up to that point, all there are
are the theoretical predictions.  Hence, one of the things test pilots
do for a living is 'push the envelope' to find out how close the
correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is -- in
essence, 'pushing back' the edges of the theoretical envelope to where
the airplane actually starts to fail to fly.  Note, too, that this is
done is a quite calculated and careful way; flight tests are generally
carefully coreographed and just what is going to be 'pushed' and how
far is precisely planned (despite occasional deviations from plans,
such as the 'early' first flight of the F-16 during its high-speed
taxi tests).

I'm sure Mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about
this process (and then some).

"[MODERATOR:  Nice summary, Keith, thanks.]

I talked to the federal Dept. of Justice (DOJ, Ottawa) to try and
clarify a bunch of things regarding changes to Canadian gun laws.
I am posting here for informational purposes; questions to email,
followup to t.p.g.

1. It is still technically feasible (but almost impossible) to get
   a concealed carry permit in Canada.  This is contrary to what I
   was told by a police officer.
2. It is still legal to use lethal force (such as a firearm) to
   protect life, also contrary to what the officer told me.  Guns
   must be stored locked up and unloaded, however.
3. Regarding hi-capacity magazines, it is still not clear who will
   be exempt or how this will be managed.  This is up to each province.
   The general idea is that exempt persons will receive a letter/form
   authorizing them to possess the high capacity magazines.  
   Apparently, the authorization is to specify how many of these
   'prohibited weapons' you will be allowed to possess.  Dealers will
   be allowed to order high capacity mags for those allowed to possess
   them, but will not be allowed to stock them.
4. High capacity magazines converted to comply with the new limits will
   not be considered prohibited weapons.  Amendments to the regulations
   specify some possible methods to alter the magazines.  Some 
   manufacturers (Beretta) will be marketing reduced capacity magazines.
   (God knows how much they'll charge for these)

This covers most of what we discussed.  I have typed this from memory,
do not take it as gospel.  I am not a lawyer and I refuse to play one on TV.

Phil> Didn't one of the early jet fighters have these?  I also think
Phil> the germans did some work on these in WWII.

The NACA came up with them before World War II.  NASA is directly
descended from the NACA, with space added in.

You'll notice that I didn't mention sweep wings even though the
X-5, tested at what's now Dryden, had them.  We did steal that one
dirctly from the Germans.  The difference is that swept wings don't
change their angle of sweep, sweep wings do.  Perhaps the similarity
of names has caused some confusion?  747s have swept wings, F-111s
have sweep wings.


Phil> A lot of this was also done by the military...

After NASA aerodynamicists proposed them and NASA test teams
demonstrated them.  Richard Whitcomb and R.T. Jones, at Langley
Research Center, were giants in the field.

Dryden was involved in the flight testing of winglets and area
ruling (in the 70s and 50s, respectively).  It's true that we
used military aircraft as the testbeds (KC-135 and YF-102) but
that had more to do with availability and need than with military
involvement.  The YF-102 was completely ours and the KC-135 was
bailed to us.  The Air Force, of course, was interested in our
results and supportive of our efforts.

Dryden flew the first digital fly by wire aircraft in the 70s. No
mechnaical or analog backup, to show you how confident we were.
General Dynamics decided to make the F-16 flyby-wire when they saw how
successful we were.  (Mind you, the Avro Arrow and the X-15 were both
fly-by-wire aircraft much earlier, but analog.)

Phil> Egad! I'm disagreeing with Mary Shafer!  

The NASA habit of acquiring second-hand military aircraft and using
them for testbeds can make things kind of confusing.  On the other
hand, all those second-hand Navy planes give our test pilots a chance
to fold the wings--something most pilots at Edwards Air Force Base
can't do.

Tommy Frandsen's VGAlib (which is probably what you're talking about)
will do the standard VGA modes, some tweaked modes and then the Tseng
ET4000 Super VGA modes. I have an ET4000 and I'm viewing GIF's at
640x480/256 (I have a lousy/small monitor) with dpg-view on Linux. I
think I had to change some constants in the dpg-view sources to make it
use the ET4k modes.

VGAlib's sources seem to be designed for easy addition of new Super VGA
support; each mode is an array of register values and there's a program
that dumps an array declaration of this kind describing the current
mode. Haven't tried it though...

"There's only one way I know of to tell an AR-15 from an M-16.
   Pick it up, hold it about a foot from your face and look closely
   at the saftey lever.  If it has two positions, its an AR-15, if
   it has three, its an M-16.  There are numerous internal differences
   as well, but since one would have to field strip the weapon to see
   them, they are not valid in this discussion.  So, in conclusion,
   there is very little external differences to distinguish an AR-15
   from an M-16 except at close (very close) range.

So?  Look in the trunk some time.  Heck - look at the dash.  That
funny thing attached with a quick-release is a gun.  The ones in the
trunk are ""better"".  (I don't have numbers for Chicago, but
Philadelphia police cars carried multiple automatic weapons and
thousands of rounds as standard issue in the 60s.)


What is the nature of this disadvantage?  If the cop can shoot, 6
rounds will do the job against a single opponent (especially since the
cop has guaranteed backup).  If the ""gang member"" can shoot, the extra
rounds don't help.  The only time this difference can matter is if
neither can shoot, and cops aren't supposed to be throwing lead around
like that.

BTW - most cops carry multiple guns.  You're not supposed to know
about the second, third, and so on.


How do ""we"" know that they were gang members and not undercover cops
or even law-abiding menacing minorities.  BTW - Why the sneer quotes?

They were actually practicing

Then the extra rounds won't make any difference, so why is it an issue?

"Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday
     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four
game series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.
""What could be better,"" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs
are challenging?
     ""It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,"" announced
Ryne Sandberg.  ""If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or
Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to
win.
     ""Lord, I hope we pull it off.""
     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete
Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut
the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw
to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.
     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to
third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him
beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this
year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a
gap in right-center.  ""Cool Papa"" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off
and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone
grounded out to second, ending the threat.  
     ""Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or
Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on
Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells
Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to
sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.""  So came the
analysis from Frank Chance.
     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder
moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled
home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it
3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein
singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped
out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,
Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.
He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting
for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into
a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a
strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick
Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a
pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The
Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.
     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get
another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock
played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen
was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against
Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving
home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added
another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen
had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more
runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.
     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one
point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off
Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but
the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce
Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the
eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would
conclude their series with the Expos on Monday.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st
     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.
The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the
all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first
first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of
first in this wacky season.
     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2
Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.
The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve
Rogers 3-2.  ""We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our
team speed,"" remarked Lou Brock.  ""I don't see why we can't win this
division.""
     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of
the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,
now 2 back - but in 4th!
    ""When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a
pitcher's park like this,"" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith
Hernandez added that ""their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,
and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.""  The Pirates have made only
26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend
to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.
     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone
Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When
Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the
Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the
.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert
Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed
fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home
runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph
Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the
top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie
Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on
first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent
Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in
left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing
Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the
Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve
allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right
field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered
to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep
center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park
homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,
and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.
------------------------------------------------------------------
     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): 
    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants
managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting
pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,
""once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming
week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.""
     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and
the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel
faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer
haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.
Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don
Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had
one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's
doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the
National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.
They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after
retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but
faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.
     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the
first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the
Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.
The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to
three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell
Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather
good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the
trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of
course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the
outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.
     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two
home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray
Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel
Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was
scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after
10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working
his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and
Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,
and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the
Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly
emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):
     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the
wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in
the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  ""Normally,"" Drysdale remarked, ""I
would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford
to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't
Davis will get decked once.""
     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is
primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his
current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is
a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is
the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw
two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of
the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all
around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The
foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,
with center field at 420 feet.  ""It's as if some three-year-old threw a
tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit
home runs',"" remarked Roy Campanella.
     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize
the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,
Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,
according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the
Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with
a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the
Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to
erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened
to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.
Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.
     ""I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,"" he explained.
     ""How can we do that,"" Pee Wee Reese wondered.
     ""They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to
throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I
want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with
a shallow infield almost the whole time.""
     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight
innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran
pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and
third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The
Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan
Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando
Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers'
thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.
     ""We're mostly a power team,"" remarked Ron Cey.  ""Jackie and, when he
plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other
plays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I
guess that's why they're so successful there.""  Indeed, it seems that
basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros
swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

"The following is an introduction as to who is Muhammad SAW
as will be covered with this treatise.

MUHAMMAD peace and blessings of Allah be upon him (SAW)
is the last prophet of Islam.  He is the Prophet who is revealed
the last Holy Scripture, Qur'an, by Allah SWA (all praise be to Him)
through the Arch Angel Gabriel.  He is the seal of all prophets
till the day of judgement as stated in the Qur'an by Allah
SWA (all praise be to Him).  Muhammad SAW lived between
571-632 AC.  All other prophethoods claimed after Muhammad SAW,
is a treason against Islam, against Qur'an, against the message
of Allah SWA.  Muhammad SAW is from the seed of Ishmael, another
messenger of Allah and son of Abraham also a messenger of Allah.
He is the Messenger that previous holy scriptures foretold his
coming.  The above mentioned verse from the Qur'an is from 
Chapter 33, Verse 40 whose rough translation is as follows:

	Muhammad is not the father of any of your men,
	but (he is) the messenger of Allah, and the seal
	of the prophets, and Allah has full knowledge of
	all things.

---------------------
Commentary on the above verse:  When a document is sealed,
it is complete, and there can be no further addition.  The 
Holy Prophet Muhammad SAW closed the long line of Messengers.
Allah's teaching is and will always be continuous, but there
has been and will be NO Prophet after Muhammad SAW.  The later
ages will want thinkers, and revivers, not Prophets.  This is not
an arbitrary matter.  It is a decree full of knowledge and wisdom,
""for Allah has full knowledge of all things.""

------------------------------------------------------------------
   		 NINETEENTH LETTER  

		 MU'JIZAT-I AHMEDIYE RISALESI 
(A TREATISE ON THE MIRACLES OF MUHAMMED SAW)       

(continued from Droplet Vol 1, No 11, Part 1)

   SECOND  SIGN:   The  Noble  Messenger  (SAW)
declared His prophethood, and presented to humanity a
decree as the Glorious Qur'an and manifest miracles
which number, according to the scholars, one thousand.
The occurrence of those miracles in their entirety is as
certain as the fact that He declared himself prophet.  In
fact, as a shown by the words of the  most obstinate
unbelievers quoted in various places of the Wise
Our'an, even they could not deny the occurrence of His
miracles, but only called them -hasha wa kella!-(Allah forbids) 
sorcery, in order to satisfy themselves, or to deceive their
followers.  The miracles of Muhammad (SAW) have the
certainty of confirmation by consensus of Ulema (scholars
of Islam) to the hundreth degree.
   The Miracle is the conformation by the CREATOR of
the universe of His declaration of Prophethood; it has the
effect of the words,'You have indeed spoken the truth !'
   Suppose that you said in the assembly of a ruler,
while being observed by Him, 'The true ruler has
appointed me to such and such position.  'At a time when
you were asked to prove your claim, the word 'Yes'
uttered by the ruler would sufficiently support you.  Or, if
the ruler changed his usual practice and attitude at your
request, this would confirm your claim even more soundly
and more definitely than would the word 'Yes.'
   In the same way, ALLAH's Most Noble Messenger
claimed: 'I am the envoy of the CREATOR of this
universe.  My proof is that He will change His unbroken
order at my request and my prayer.  Now look at my
fingers:  He makes them run like a fountain with five
spigots.  Look at the moon: by a gesture of my finger, He
splits it in two.  Look at that tree: to affirm me, and to bear
witness to me, it moves and comes near to me.  Look at
this food: although it is barely enough for two or three
men, it satisfies two or three hundred.  'Further he shows
hundreds of similar miracles.  However, the evidences  of
the veracity of this high being and the proofs of his
prophethood are not restricted to his miracles.  All his
deeds and acts, his words and behavior, his moral
conduct and manners, his character and appearance
prove to the attentive his truthfulness and seriousness.
Indeed, many people  such  as  Abdullah  b. Salam,  the
famous scholar of the Children of Israel, came to belief
merely by seeing him, and said, 'No lie can hide in this
face, nor can any fraud be found in it!'
   Although many of the  researchers have concluded
that the proofs of the prophethood of Muhammad and his
miracles number about one thousand, there are
thousands, perhaps hundreds of thousands of proofs  of
his prophethood.  And hundreds of thousands of
truth-seeking men (muhakkikiin) with varying opinions
have affirmed his prophethood in an equal number of
ways.
   The Wise Our'an alone demonstrates thousands of
the proofs of his prophethood, in addition to its own forty
aspects of miraculousness.  Since prophethood is as a
phenomenon of humanity, and hundreds of thousands of
individuals who claimed prophethood and performed
miracles have lived and passed away; then, the
prophethood of Muhammad (SAW) is of a certanity
superior to that of the prophethood of all the others.  For
whatever evidences, qualities  and attributes  became the
means of the prophethood and messengership of all the
messengers such as Jesus (AS) and Moses (AS), they
are all owned in a more perfect and comprehensive
fashion by Muhammad (SAW).  And since the causes and
means of prophetic authority exist more perfectly in the
person of Muhammad (SAW), this authority is to be found
in him with more certanity than all the other prophets.

Programmatically, yes, we can land an Orbiter with a 5 cm hole in
the wall -- provided that the thing which caused 5 cm hole didn't
cause a Crit 1 failure on some of the internal systems.  There are
a few places where a 5 cm hole would cause a Bad Day -- especially
if the 5 cm hole went all the way through the Orbiter and out the
other side, as could easily happen with a meteor strike.  But a
hole in the pressure vessel would cause us to immediately de-orbit
to the next available landing site.

"
First off, let me congratulate you for not posting a flame about ""You sick
perverts, you are immoral, you are all going to hell."", which seems to be the
usual ""religious"" post found on the alt.sex.* hierarchy.  Hopefully, you won't
get flamed, either.

You will, however, be argued with.  I personally think that your project is
built on unsteady ground.

First, I do not believe that there is any way to find an ""objective morality"". 
Morality and value are inherently subjective - they represent the beliefs of a
person or a group of people.  They can be widely held, perhaps even
overwhelmingly held, but they are never and _can_ never be objective.


Second, I do not accept the assumptions that you make here.  If, as you say,
you are trying to be objective, then why accept a morality to begin with by
using the Christian Bible?  You're defeating your own purpose by doing so.
 

Third, call me a pessimist, but you won't stop the flamage.  There will always
be people who pop upin alt.sex.* to tell us how sick and twisted and evil we
all are.  Just out of curiosity, do alt.sex readers show up unprovoked in the
religion groups to tell you all that you are narrow-minded, censoring,
overbearing totalitarianists?
 

Hm.  Let me provide an example.  Four people get together over dinner, to
discuss morality: you, me, a rather conservative Moslem, and a sociopath.  I
start off by saying that I think it's immoral to force people to have sex with
you.  You agree, but also say that it is immoral to have sex with someone of
your own gender.  (Just a note: I really don't know your views on
homosexuality, I am just using this as a common view of morality for the
purposes of this example.)  The Moslem says that it is immoral for women to
have their faces uncovered.

The sociopath, who has become bored, kills all three of us and eats us, but
feels no guilt because he has done nothing wrong morally in his own mind. 
                                                                         

	(Evidence deleted)

I'm not going to accept your evidence for this.  You ask us to accept ""The Word
of God"" that everything good comes from God.  This is only a valid argument for
a person who shares your beliefs.

Still, I must say that cataloging the major themes and motifs in erotica could
be interesting for other reasons than yours, so good luck with this next part.


Hmmm...do I detect just a wee bit of condescence here?
                                                      
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
				not very objective. 


One could construe this to mean that beautiful people are better, or ""more
good"" than non-beautiful people.  I would hope that people relize that this is
not necessarily true.

      Might I suggest the word ""penis""? It seems more in line with the tone of

Yes, and this theme is usually what the better stories are about.  However,
they are not always selfish - I could point to examples in the work of Elf
Sternberg, for example.


It serves the same purpose as it does in pornographic movies: it affirms the
virility of the male involved, as well as assuring the reader that he (the
character) has orgasmed.                      


Your Whole Picture [TM] unfortunately only applies to people who accept your
church.
         
In addition, if sex is for procreation, then

1)	Why did God make it pleasurable, so that people would want to do it,
rather than building it in as instinct?
2)	Why did God make it fallible?  Not every sexual encounter results in
pregnancy, even among Catholics.  Does this mean that they have sinned?
 
 
Granted.


Pornography would not tend in those directions if there were not a demand for
it.  Many people have violent fantasies that they would never act out in real
life, but will think about and read about and mull over.

That is, is there some mechanism (cosmic rays, whatever) that
could cause the dector to _think_ it was seeing one of these
things?",space
"
One consideration to remember is that if you don't turn it off now,
you may not be able to later.  This isn't a case of reaching over and
flipping a switch; much of the spacecraft has to be working correctly
to execute a ""turn off"" command successfully.  Spacecraft do malfunction
in their old age.  The big concern is not radio clutter from idle
spacecraft, but radio clutter from malfunctioning spacecraft that can
no longer be turned off.",space
"Are breathable liquids possible?

I remember seeing an old Nova or The Nature of Things where this idea was
touched upon (it might have been some other TV show).  If nothing else, I know
such liquids ARE possible because...

They showed a large glass full of this liquid, and put a white mouse (rat?) in
it.  Since the liquid was not dense, the mouse would float, so it was held down
by tongs clutching its tail.  The thing struggled quite a bit, but it was
certainly held down long enough so that it was breathing the liquid.  It never
did slow down in its frantic attempts to swim to the top.

Now, this may not have been the most humane of demonstrations, but it certainly
shows breathable liquids can be made.",space

CONTACTING NASA, ESA, AND OTHER SPACE AGENCIES/COMPANIES

Many space activities center around large Government or International
Bureaucracies.	In the US that means NASA.  If you have basic information
requests: (e.g., general PR info, research grants, data, limited tours, and
ESPECIALLY SUMMER EMPLOYMENT (typically resumes should be ready by Jan.  1),
etc.), consider contacting the nearest NASA Center to answer your questions.

EMail typically will not get you any where, computers are used by
investigators, not PR people. The typical volume of mail per Center is a
multiple of 10,000 letters a day. Seek the Public Information Office at one
of the below, this is their job:

NASA (The National Aeronautics and Space Administration) is the
civilian space agency of of the United States Federal Government.
It reports directly to the White House and is not a Cabinet
post such as the military Department of Defense.  Its 20K+ employees
are civil servants and hence US citizens.  Another 100K+ contractors
also work for NASA.

NASA CENTERS

    NASA Headquarters (NASA HQ)
    Washington DC 20546

    Pasadena, CA 91109
    (818)-354-5011

	The ""heavies"" in planetary research probes and other unmanned
	projects (they also had a lot to do with IRAS). They run Voyager,
	Magellan, Galileo, and will run Cassini, CRAF, etc. etc.. For
	images, probe navigation, and other info about unmanned exploration,
	this is the place to go.

	JPL is run under contract for NASA by the nearby California
	Institute of Technology, unlike the NASA centers above. This
	distinction is subtle but critical. JPL has different requirements
	for unsolicited research proposals and summer hires. For instance in
	the latter, an SF 171 is useless. Employees are Caltech employees,
	contractors, and for the most part have similar responsibilities.
	They offer an alternative to funding after other NASA Centers.

=============================================================
Hi Folks;

Thursday, April 15 marked Day 3 of the trial.

This day marked the first testimony of the trial.  Deputy
U.S. Marshal Larry Cooper took the stand for the prosecution.

The short version is that his testimony was consistent with
the opening statements for the prosecution.

Cooper testified that he had arrived in Spokane (Washington)
on August 17, 1992 to participate in a surveillance operation
with five other deputies near the Weaver cabin.  The team was
using night vision equipment for surveillance, and split up
into two teams of three people.  The six later met at an
observation point above the cabin.  After this, deputies
Cooper, William Degan, and Arthur Roderick began a descent to
scout further possible surveillance sites.

Cooper told the court that Roderick threw two large rocks into
a gully to see, ""whether the [Weaver family] dogs would respond.""
Striker, the Weaver's yellow lab, started toward them barking
loudly.  Roderick led the three in a run from the area.

They ran through some dense woods into an open area [called the
""fern field""] with the dog in pursuit.  By this time, Kevin
Harris and Samuel Weaver had joined the chase.  The surveillance
team had reached a Y in the road: Cooper decided that they should
take cover in the woods because otherwise they would be an easy
target and might be ""shot in the back.""

As Degan reached the Y, he spotted Randy Weaver coming down the
road from the cabin ahead.  Weaver was startled but did not fire.

At this moment, Striker reached Degan, and Cooper had to ""fend
him off with his gun.""  [It is unclear whether this means he
clubbed the dog or shot the dog].  Both Cooper and Degan then
took cover in the woods.  According to Cooper, Kevin Harris and
Samuel Weaver continued walking down the road, apparently not
noticing the two.  After they had passed by on the road, Degan
got up on one knee, raised his gun, and shouted, ""Stop!  U.S.
Marshal!""  Harris then ""...brought the weapon around at hip level
and fired.  He didn't bring the weapon up to eye level.  I saw
Bill's arm going back, and I knew he had been hit.""  Cooper fired
at Harris, and Harris went down.  Cooper then brought his weapon
to bear on Samuel, but did not fire.  At this point, Cooper then
heard two shots to his right.  Samuel Weaver looked in the
direction of the shots, yelled, ""You son of a bitch!"" and ran
toward them.  Cooper then realized that shots were coming at him
from directly ahead, so he fired a three-round burst at the
cabin.  At this point he then saw Samuel Weaver running toward
the cabin.  When Cooper reached Degan, he placed his first two
fingers on Degan carotid artery, counted two or three beats, and
then his heart stopped.  Shortly thereafter, Roderick and the
other three marshals joined him.  They then all heard a large
burst of gunfire from the area around the cabin.

On cross-examination, David Nevin questioned the point of
throwing rocks into the gulley, asking, ""You wanted to lure that
dog out so you could shoot that dog, didn't you?""  Nevin also
pointed out that in last September's testimony, Cooper had
claimed that he spotted Weaver after the dog had left him.
Cooper claimed that he had gone over the events in his head and
decided that Thursday's account was correct.  Nevin continued the
cross-examination by asking what Cooper would have done had an
armed man dressed in full camouflage jumped out of the woods at
him [no answer was available].

Friday, April 16 marks continued cross-examination of Cooper.

Notes: There was no coverage of protestors.

I don't think your objection is beyond the bounds of rationality.  The
right mentioned in the bill is already established under the Second
Amendment; the bill should be reworded to reaffirm the Second Amendment

court system.

The right already exists and is already embodied in our Constitution.",politics

It may be that they just didn't mention it, or that they actually haven't 
thought about it.  I got the vague impression from their mission proposal
that they weren't taking a very holistic aproach to the whole thing.  They
seemed to want to land people on the Moon by the end of the decade without 
explaining why, or what they would do once they got there.  The only application
I remember from the Av Week article was placing a telescope on the Moon.  That's
great, but they don't explain why it can't be done robotically.

	NPR's Morning Edition aired a report this morning (4/19) on
	Hispanic/Latin American players in MLB and how they have many of
	the same problems faced by black/negro/African American players
	when they first entered the league.  However, although baseball
	has adjusted to the presence of black players, many Hispanic
	players still labor under the stereotype of being ""fireballs,
	hot blooded, flashy"".  The report also emphasised that despite
	the rantings (my word) of Jessie Jackson about baseballs
	discrimination against black players in its upper echelons,
	baseball has actually done much better by black players than
	Hispanic players.

	Another interesting point was the language barrier problem.  The
	reporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he
	gave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with
	the fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that
	speak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if not
	the) easiest languages to learn, so easy that the author Cormac
	McCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research his
	book, _All The Pretty Horses_.  Yet, few MLB organizations
	employ Spanish speaking personel, one of the exceptions being
	the Oakland A's.

	Another point:

	Nearly 90% of Latin American players have some African blood.
	Yet, most report that they'd never really felt black until
	playing ball in the US.

  
	Ironically enough, it is the early presence of Latin American
	baseball players in the Major Leagues that support the idea that
	baseball was integrated before the arrival of Jackie Robinson,
	as many ""light black"" or ""brown"", Latin Americans were
	incorporated into baseball.

believe that my way is the only way!  I'm not a ""creation scientist""!  I

If you want to discuss bible thumpers, you would be better off singling
out (and making obtuse generalizations about) Fundamentalists.  If you
compared the actions of Presbyterians or Methodists with those of Southern 
Baptists, you would think that they were different religions!

"Hello,
I purchased my new 486 with a NoName graphics card installed which is obviously 
Speedstar 24 compatible. Its name is ""VGA 4000 TrueColor"".
It is accompanied with some drivers and the utilities VMODE, XMODE and
at least one more MODE, as well as some drivers for Lotus, Windows, etc.
Only one of the drivers is told to provide the TrueColor mode, namely
the Windows 3.1 driver.
Nowhere else, except in the ad, is any pointer to the TrueColor mode.
Some articles in this group about the Speedstar 24 and some other facts
made me believe that my card is compatible to that one.

Does anybody out there know how this mode can be adjusted? How can I write
a driver which allows me to have 16.7 millions of colors with a resolution

"Hi everyone,

I thought that some people may be interested in my VR
software on these groups:

*******Announcing the release of Multiverse-1.0.2*******

Multiverse is a multi-user, non-immersive, X-Windows based Virtual Reality
system, primarily focused on entertainment/research.

Features:

   Client-Server based model, using Berkeley Sockets.
   No limit to the number of users (apart from performance).
   Generic clients.
   Customizable servers.
   Hierachical Objects (allowing attachment of cameras and light sources).
   Multiple light sources (ambient, point and spot).
   Objects can have extension code, to handle unique functionality, easily
        attached.

Functionality:

  Client:
   The client is built around a 'fast' render loop. Basically it changes things
   when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user's
   viewpoint. It also provides the server with information about the user's
   actions - which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to
   other users.

   The client is designed to be generic - in other words you don't need to
   develop a new client when you want to enter a new world. This means that
   resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting
   it. The adaptations, as will be explained in a moment, occur in the servers.

   This release of the client software supports the following functionality:

    o Hierarchical Objects (with associated addressing)

    o Multiple Light Sources and Types (Ambient, Point and Spot)

    o User Interface Panels

    o Colour Polygonal Rendering with Phong Shading (optional wireframe for
	faster frame rates)

    o Mouse and Keyboard Input

   (Some people may be disappointed that this software doesn't support the
   PowerGlove as an input device - this is not because it can't, but because
   I don't have one! This will, however, be one of the first enhancements!)

  Server(s):
   This is where customization can take place. The following basic support is
   provided in this release for potential world server developers:

    o Transparent Client Management

    o Client Message Handling

   This may not sound like much, but it takes away the headache of
accepting and
   terminating clients and receiving messages from them - the
application writer
   can work with the assumption that things are happening locally.

   Things get more interesting in the object extension functionality. This is
   what is provided to allow you to animate your objects:

    o Server Selectable Extension Installation:
        What this means is that you can decide which objects have extended
        functionality in your world. Basically you call the extension
        initialisers you want.

    o Event Handler Registration:
        When you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback
        functions for the events that you want the object to respond to.
        (Current events supported: INIT, MOVE, CHANGE, COLLIDE & TERMINATE)

    o Collision Detection Registration:
        If you want your object to respond to collision events just provide
        some basic information to the collision detection management software.
        Your callback will be activated when a collision occurs.

    This software is kept separate from the worldServer applications because
    the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects
    from which to choose.

    The following is all you need to make a World Server application:

    o Provide an initWorld function:
        This is where you choose what object extensions will be supported, plus
        any initialization you want to do.

    o Provide a positionObject function:
        This is where you determine where to place a new client.

    o Provide an installWorldObjects function:
        This is where you load the world (.wld) file for a new client.

    o Provide a getWorldType function:
        This is where you tell a new client what persona they should have.

    o Provide an animateWorld function:
        This is where you can go wild! At a minimum you should let the objects
        move (by calling a move function) and let the server sleep for a bit
        (to avoid outrunning the clients).

    That's all there is to it! And to prove it here are the line counts for the
    three world servers I've provided:

        generic - 81 lines
        dactyl - 270 lines (more complicated collision detection due to the
                           stairs! Will probably be improved with future
                           versions)
        dogfight - 72 lines

Location:

   This software is located at the following site:
   ftp.u.washington.edu

   Directory:
   pub/virtual-worlds

   File:
   multiverse-1.0.2.tar.Z

Futures:

   Client:

    o Texture mapping.

    o More realistic rendering: i.e. Z-Buffering (or similar), Gouraud shading

    o HMD support.

    o Etc, etc....

   Server:

    o Physical Modelling (gravity, friction etc).

    o Enhanced Object Management/Interaction

    o Etc, etc....

   Both:

    o Improved Comms!!!

I hope this provides people with a good understanding of the Multiverse
software,
unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation, and I'm not sure
whether that will ever be able to be rectified! :-(

I hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of
the Virtual Universe - I've certainly found fascinating developing it, and I
would *LOVE* to add support for the PowerGlove...and an HMD :-)!!

Finally one major disclaimer:

This is totally amateur code. By that I mean there is no support for this code
other than what I, out the kindness of my heart, or you, out of pure
desperation, provide. I cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad
that may happen through the use of this code - USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK!

Disclaimer over!

Of course if you love it, I would like to here from you. And anyone with
POSITIVE contributions/criticisms is also encouraged to contact me. Anyone who
hates it: > /dev/null!

might also be an artificial entity that is created by government

don't understand is how a statute like 922 can be enforced on 
an individual. So someone tell me how my government can tell
me what I can or cannot possess. Just passing a law 
does not make it LAW. Everyone knows that laws are constitional

You're assuming that the low-cost delivery system has to be a separate
project.  But why?  If you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars
in hopes of winning a billion-dollar prize, it is *cheaper* to develop
your own launch system, charging its entire development cost against
your contest entry, than to try to do it with existing launchers.  No
other demand is necessary.


You're assuming that it's going to take a decade to build a new launch
system.  But why?  The Saturn V took less than six years, depending on
exactly when you date its start.  Pegasus took about three from project
start to first flight.  Before SDIO chickened out on orbital development,
the target date for an orbital DC-Y flight was 1996.  If you really want
speed, consider that the first prototypes of the Thor missile (still in
service as the core of the Delta launcher) shipped to the USAF less
than 18 months after the development go-ahead.",space
"

Atoms are not objective.  They aren't even real.  What scientists call
an atom is nothing more than a mathematical model that describes 
certain physical, observable properties of our surroundings.  All
of which is subjective.  

What is objective, though, is the approach a scientist 
takes in discussing his model and his observations.  There
is no objective science.  But there is an objective approach
which is subjectively selected by the scientist.  Objective
in this case means a specified, unchanging set of rules that
he and his colleagues use to discuss their science.

This is in contrast to your Objective Morality.  There may be an
objective approach to subjectively discuss your beliefs on
morality.  But there exists no objective morality.

Also, science deals with how we can discuss our observations of 
the physical world around us.  In that the method of discussion
is objective ( not the science; not the discussion itself ).

Science makes no claims to know the whys or even the hows sometimes
of what we can observe.  It simply gives us a way to discuss our
surroundings in a meaningful, consistent way.

I think it was Neils Bohr who said (to paraphrase) Science is what
we can _say_ about the physical world.",religion

                         ^^^^^^^ Militia

                  ^^^^^ State

        ^^^^ Arms

You didn't even get the capitalization correct!  Try reading USCA on
the Constitution, or get any other CORRECT version of the
Constitution. 


Perhaps you should actually READ the Federalist Papers!!

    James Madison, Federalist Paper 46: ""Besides the advantage of
    being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost
    every other nation, the existence of subordinate governments, to
    which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers
    are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of
    ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government
    of any form can admit of.  Notwithstanding the military
    establishments in the several kingdoms of Europe, which are
    carried as far as the public resources will bear, the governments
    are afraid to trust the people with arms.""
                  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    James Madison, I Annals of Congress 434, 8 June 1789: ""The right
    of the people to keep and bear... arms shall not be infringed.  A
    well regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,
                            ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    trained to arms, is the best and most natural defense of a free
    country...""

    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (on the organization of
    the militia): ""Little more can reasonably be aimed at, with
    respect to the people at large, than to have them properly armed
               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    and equipped; and in order to see that this be not neglected, it
    will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of
    a year.""

    Alexander Hamilton, Federalist Paper 29 (speaking of standing
    armies): ""... if circumstances should at any time oblige the
    government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be
    formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large
    body of citizens, little, if at all, inferior to them in
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    discipline and the use of arms, who stand ready to defend their
                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****
    own rights and those of their fellow-citizens.""
    ***^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

But *surely* Hamilton and Madison didn't mean the PEOPLE when they
said ""people"", right?  That's why the Amendment refers to ""the Right
of the Militia""?...  ;-)


You're right, the Militia consists of ALL able bodied males (and
probably females under current interpretation). 


The Amendment does nor refer to ""well organized"", it says ""well
regulated"".  I have some targets you may examine if you wish to check
how _well regulated_ I am. 



Correct.  That's why the Right is reserved to the People.  And that
was to insure the People could form a ""well regulated Militia"", not a
""well organized militia"".


What do Atomic Units have to do with this argument?  Any moron can set
h_bar = C = 1...


Oh, I see what your question is; Why don't you read the federalist
Papers?! 

    James Madison, Federalist Paper 41 (regarding the ""General
    Welfare"" clause): ""Nothing is more natural nor common than first
    to use a general phrase, and then to explain and qualify it by a
    recital of particulars.""

But what does Madison know about the grammatical style of the 2nd?  He
only wrote it.


That's obviously because you've never actually *read* the Federalist
Papers. 


Can't read, huh?  Show me where the document says ""well organized
militia"". 


That is *exactly* why EVERY PERSON should be allowed to own *any*
weapon currently in use in the armed forces.


But the major reason is to protect against that very same army.


    Abraham Lincoln, First Inaugural Address, March 4, 1861: ""This
    country, with its institutions, belongs to the people who inhabit
    it.  Whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government,
    they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it, or
    their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it.""

    Rep. Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts, spoken during floor debate
    over the Second Amendment, I Annals of Congress at 750, 17 August
    1789: ""What, Sir, is the use of a militia?  It is to prevent the
    establishment of a standing army, the bane of liberty. ...
    Whenever Governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of
    the people, they always attempt to destroy the militia, in order
    to raise an army upon their ruins.""

So now we know which category Mr. Rutledge is in; He means to destroy
our Liberties and Rights.

"I am working on a project where we are going to be including
both still and moving grapics within a database.  Of course
JPEG and MPEG come to mind as the formats of choice for the
various files.  However, from what I read on the Net, it seems
as if there are several different forms of each of these.

What I want to do, is settle on a file format which I can count
on as being a standard format 10 years from now.  I know Apple is going
to support Quicktime on the new Power PC's and, so this
may be the format of choice.

What format does Apple's Quicktime use for their products?  I guess
it is some kind of MPEG for their motion picture. Is it any different
than standard MPEG files?

Thanx for any info!",graphics

Sorry, Bryan, this is not quite correct. Remember the VGALIB package that comes
with Linux/SLS? It will switch to VGA 320x200x256 mode *without* Xwindows.
So at least it is *possible* to write a GIF viewer under Linux. However I don't
think that there exists a similar SVGA package, and viewing GIFs in 320x200 is
not very nice.

Here at Lewis and Clark College we have recently installed a Digital Film
system (based on the Mac Quadra) that does non-linear, full digital editing.

If you're considering such a system, here are the pros and cons:

For the educational environment, this system is excellent.  We use it to
produce a variety of educational materials for disemination on our local
network.  Because this programming is going to be viewed on other Macs, the
image quality is not as important as the ability to directly export the
video to the Net.

We also use it to produce orientiation and promotional video programs for
use by the Lewis & Clark community.  Since these programs are not meant for
commercial or broadcast use, image quality is not critical.

The Digital Film system, for those of you who are uninitiated, is an A/B roll
digitizing system on one $5000 JPEG compression card.  It was promoted as
an inexpensive online editing system with SVHS quality.  SuperMac, the maker
of the card, is trying to achieve this quality level, but as yet, has been
unable to deliver.  Our system produces ""near VHS"" quality at 30 fields per
second (640x480 overscan).  The card repeats every other field to get 60
fields per second.  This results in a kind of Super 8 film look that some
find distracting.

If you can get past this problem, you'll find the Adobe Premier editing 
software quite enjoyable with which to work.  It produces thousands of
different effects from crystalize filters to DVE transitions to color matting.

Because of its non-linear nature, editing is fast and easy.  If you've ever
used (or seen used) an AVID or Montage system, you'll recognize the methodology
and the user interface.

The total system with Quadra 950 (40Megs of RAM), 1 gig drive, 21"" Apple mon-
itor, Panasonic SVHS 1960 edit deck, audio gear (cassette, CD, EQ, mixer, etc),
Composite monitor, Digital Film card will set you back about $20,000.

For you video cowboys and girls, this system will not output at a quality
that will satisfy most of your clients.  Even though you can perform more
effects than a toasterhead can imagine, an Amiga based off-line based system
will look better.

We use both Macs and Amigas for our video work.  Each for what each does best!

"  That was the entire point to *you*.  What exactly did I claim?
     --------------------------------------------------
    ""I've heard eye-witness descriptions of tanks using their main guns
  to respond to sniper fire.  Quite effectively.""
     --------------------------------------------------
  
    I wasn't wrong . . . I've heard those descriptions.  If you're
  paying attention, I've mentioned that I saw the tanks with my own
  eyes, but the main gun firing was an account I heard.  That helps
  people judge whether or not to kick in the, to use your words,
  ""bullshit filters"".  Stating that I *claimed* this is a falsehood.
  
Later in the same post:
     Another part of my memories was that while most damaged building
  were burnt, some were in rubble.  Based on what I remember, I was and
  am inclined to believe an old sarge or two.

Fine, *now* you are stating that you believe their claims (or that you are
""inclined"" to.  See below for a stronger statement of your beliefs).  Those
claims are still ludicrous, however.

Previously Awesley had written:
  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.

Prompting me to write:
  To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion
  grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be
  perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since
  it makes your other claim seem more plausible.

To which Awesley replied:
  John, again, strawman techniques.  Do you feel you're losing it so you
  have to stretch what I said and knock that down?  What I read said
  nothing about what they fired.  And so I put nothing in there.  If you
  need some help, let me know and I'l take your side of this for a
  while.  You're not scoring here, you're boring here.

But why did you mention grenade launchers at all?  Because it supports the
notion that the tanks shelled buildings.  And it supports that notion
because it conjures images of troops launching fragmentary grenades.  But
that too is ludicrous.

  If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been
  screaming about it for the past two and half decades.  I would know about
  it. 

Awesley relied:
     Glad to know you're such an expert.  Nice to hear some an
  authority.  I especially appreciate your basis of knowledge -- if it
  had happened, you would have know it.  Since you are such an
  authority, you probably know that people did scream about an alleged
  massive cover-up in the number of people killed in the Detroit riot.
  Some claimed 100+ dead, others said 300.  The offical number is 43 but
  the Concise Columbia Encyclopedia says it was ""several"".  I've also
  heard some things about that but I won't dare repeat them.  You'd
  assert that I claimed they were truth.

Yes, if it happened I would have heard about it.  Everybody would have. 
Army tanks don't fire their cannons in American cities in the 1960's
without it becoming common knowledge, without minority leaders seizing on
it and condemning it over and over again, without civil libertarians saying
""this has gone far enough.""  So, yes, my never hearing of it was the basis
for my disbelieving the claim.  Now I have more reasons to disbelieve it. 
Not one poster has written to say, yes, I lived in Detroit at that time and
everybody knew that the tanks had fired shells.  This is the UseNet.  If it
had happened, somebody here would remember it.  Furthermore, your own
research failed to come up with any support for the claim.  The claim is
extraordinary and it has no supporting evidence, extraordinary or not. 
Unless you count the brags of a couple of guardsmen shooting the shit.  I
do not.

  Unless you also claim that the National Guard managed to cover it up. 

     Taking the tour after the riots, it was pretty easy to tell the 
  difference between Army and Guard troops.  Or so I recall from 26 
  years ago.  And I seem to recall it was the Army running the tanks.
  So it would have been an Army cover-up.

Quibble.  Fine, it was an Army cover-up.  Six years in the Reserves has
taught me the difference also.  But do you think that in two and half
decades not one guilt-ridden participant has come forward and said ""yes, I
shelled Americans,"" or ""I gave the orders to fire the cannons,"" or ""I
helped cover it up""?

  If your mind is open enough to believe that, well, good for you.  I
prefer
  to live in reality.   And here in reality, I find it hard to believe that
  those tanks even had any shells, much less fired them.

Awesley replied:
    Given the level in destruction in Detroit, I'm quite willing to believe
  that they did fire their guns.

Good.  Then we can drop the junk about you not claiming that they did. 
Your belief fails a basic reality check: why isn't it known?

Awesley concludes:
     Now then, we've bored the shit out of anyone whose bothered to read
  this far and all you've managed to say is that you don't believe the
  account I cited.

Actually, now we have established that I don't believe what you believe, as
well as why I don't believe it.  And if it's boring, then I yield the last
word to you, if you want it.  You may say anything you like with
impunity--I am dropping the subject.",politics

Yes, I am pro-gun, and yes, I do disagree with this statement.
Nuclear weapons in and of themselves are dangerous.  Radioactive
decay of plutonium and uranium, as well as the tritium in the
weapon, tends to be somewhat dangerous to living things.
(Can you say ""neutron flux""?)  Plus these things have no self-
defense purposes.  It's kinda hard to justify their use as
a militia weapon when at best they are meant for battlefield use
(low-yield weapons) or at worst for industrial target obliteration
(translation:  cities and population centers).  Not to mention that
for it to be used as a militia weapon and expect the user to live

Again, I'd like to see some evidence.

knocked over a lantern.
 

Evidence please?


I'd like to point out that the Bible says ""Do not commit murder."" The NKJ

reason why they were stockpiling weapons is because they were afraid the

"Hi. I've just finished reading S414, and have several questions about
the Brady bills (S414 and HR1025).

1. _Are_ these the current versions of the Brady bill?
     What is the status of these bills?  I've heard they're ""in committee"".
     How close is that to being made law?

2. S414 and HR1025 seem fairly similar.  Are there any important
   differences I missed?

3. S414 seems to have some serious loopholes:
  A. S414 doesn't specify an ""appeals"" process to wrongful denial during
     the waiting period, other than a civil lawsuit(?)  (S414 has an appeals
     process once the required instant background check system is established,
     but not before).
  B. the police are explicitly NOT liable for mistakes in denying/approving
     using existing records (so who would I sue in ""A"" above to have an
     inaccurate record corrected?)
  C. S414 includes an exception-to-waiting-period clause for if a person
     can convince the local Chief Law-Enforcement Officer (CLEO) of an
     immediate threat to his or her life, or life of a household member.
     But S414 doesn't say exactly what is considered a ""threat"", nor does
     it place a limit on how long the CLEO takes to issue an exception
     statement.
True?  Have I misunderstood?  Any other 'holes?

4. With just S414, what's to stop a person with a ""clean"" record from
   buying guns, grinding off the serial numbers, and selling them to crooks?
   At minimum, what additional laws are needed to prevent this?

   'Seems at min. a ""gun counting"" scheme would be needed
   (e.g., ""John Doe owns N guns"").  So, if S414 passes, I wouldn't be surprised
   to see legislation for stricter, harder-to-forge I.D.'s plus national gun
   registration, justified by a need to make the Brady bill work.

legislation--I don't mean to start a general discussion of the merits

[Excellent discussion of DC-X landing techniques by Henry deleted]


The DC-X will not take of horizontally.  It takes of vertically. 


For several reasons.  Vertical landings don't require miles of runway and limit
noise pollution.  They don't require wheels or wings.  Just turn on the engines
and touch down.  Of course, as Henry pointed out, vetical landings aren't quite
that simple.


Well, to be blunt, yes.  But at least you're learning.


The Soyuz vehicles use parachutes for the descent and then fire small rockets
just before they hit the ground.  Parachutes are, however, not especially
practical if you want to reuse something without much effort.  The landings
are also not very comfortable.  However, in the words of Georgy Grechko,

"There has been a lot of discussion about Tyre.  In sum, Ezekiel prophesied
that the place would be mashed and never rebuilt; as there are a lot of
people living there, it would appear that Ezekiel was not literally correct.

This doesn't bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel used
differently than do so-called Biblical literalists.  For example, it sometimes
happens that someone says ""My grandson is the cutest baby!"" and then turns
around and sees the granddaughter and says ""Oh!  Isn't she the cutest thing!?""

This person is not literally claiming to have lined up all the babies in the
world according to cuteness and discovered his own grandchildren tied for
first.  Rather, he is trying to express his emotions using words that are very
object-oriented.  Because this example is one that is common to many people,
nobody misunderstands the intent of the statements; the Bible, however, is
often at the mercy of people who assume that everything within must be exactly
literally true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre is a problem; for me,
it is not.


Turning to the latest person trying to defend Ezekiel, we read this from
John E King:


No, it implies nothing of the kind.  If you had nothing but the prophecy from
Ezekiel, and you were told you interpret it literally, you would never say
""Oh, he means that there will be houses and businesses and plants and stuff
like that.""  You would read ""I will make you a bare rock"" and ""You will never
be rebuilt"", and you'd conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The only way
to get from `fishing nets' to `houses and buildings and a medium-large
population' is if you KNOW that all that latter stuff is there.

In other words, your answer means that Ezekiel misled everybody who read the
prophecy at the time it was written.  There is no way that, given a literal
reading, they could read this passage and conclude ""medium-size city"".

You seem to feel that ""Never be rebuilt"" means ""be rebuilt"" -- maybe so, but
it is hardly a `clear implication'.




Well, no.  That's only a bit less than the population of Annapolis, where I'm
from.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington
resigned his commission in the statehouse?  Annapolis may not be New York, but
it's at least a two-horse town.

But supposing 22,000 people is a ""small town"" -- it's still 22,000 people
MORE than Ezekiel predicted.


And you've said nothing about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel
predicts that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their
valuables.  However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29
Ezekiel even quotes God as saying ""he and his army got no reward from the
campaign he led against Tyre.""

Let's ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.
Ezekiel says N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel says
that N. would plunder their valuables, but N. did NOT plunder their valuables.

Regardless of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact is that N. died before
the place was destroyed.  Ezekiel said N. was going to do it, and N. did not.

 *

This post is, of course, pointless.  Inerrantists have an amazing ability
to rewrite the Bible as needed to fit whatever they want it to say.

For example, I expect Mr King to respond to the comments about Ezekiel 26
by pulling some ""clear implications"" out of hat.

When Ezekiel said that N. would ""demolish your towers"", that clearly implied
that the walls would still be standing so people would know where the towers
used to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would ""demolish your fine houses
and throw your stones, timber and rubble into the sea"", that clearly implied
that N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.
would ""build a ramp up to your walls"", that clearly implies that N. would
spend 13 years stomping around on the mainland and never get close to the
walls.

See?  A few ""clear implications"" that are totally contrary to the text, and
you can reconcile anything you want.

I really don't understand all this!  I watched on satellite network feeds as  
perhaps 90 people died before my eyes, while the two Huey's fanned the flames,

Something was VERY wrong with that scene.

Perhaps if I'd watched RAMBO movies, I might've been dulled to the pain of  
fellow humans dying.

Thank GOD I still feel.  I'm very sorry for you who don't.  For you who think  
they got what they deserved.  Can you really believe that?  Even if Koresh was  
the sadistic mad man they said he was, did the others deserve his fate?   If,  
in fact, he was mad, wasn't that even more reason to believe he duped his  
followers, and therefore they were innocent, brainwashed, victims?  Is there  
any scenaro that justifies all that death?

And if not, it is clear that the deaths would not have occured if the BATF has  
not FUCKED UP initially, and now the FBI got impaitent and pushed Korech over  
the edge.

And that's if you buy the latest version of the ""story"" hook, line, and sinker.   
I have believed all along that they could not let them live, the embarrassment  
to the BATF and the FBI would've been too severe.

Remember, this was a suspicion of tax-evasion warrant.  There were no  
witnesses, except the FBI.  All information filtered through the FBI.  All they  
had to do was allow one remote controlled pool camera be installed near the  
building, and the press could've done their job, and would've been able to back  
the FBI's story with close up video, while incurring no risk to the press.   
Unless they did not want the public to see something.  The complete lack of any  
other source of information other than the FBI really causes me concern.

I used this combination for a while - A QCR-Z recorder,
I think - and as far as I remember Corel can EXPORT in
SCODAL (.scd) format.  Just select 'EXPORT' on the main

afternoon painfully discovering that ONE pixel had somehow
strayed off-screen, causing my whole slide to be blank!!!

The QCR-Z also couldn't handle grad-fill over grad-fill -
so if you use a graduated colour background, if you then
grad-fill an object on top of this, the fill appears on the
final slide as a circle (I think) and TOTALLY IGNORES the

I don't personally, but Clay just posted it.  Yes, we do.  

Unfortunately, it shows that Lopez wasn't as good an example as Nieves would
have been, since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous
years (which I didn't have access to).

The point remains, though; knowing a guy's minor league history is as good
as knowing his major league history, if you know how to read it.


The MLE is not a *projection*, it's an *equivalence*.  It's a ""this is how
well he hit *last* year, in major league terms"" rating.  So, in essence, he
has *already* reached it.  I would guess (Bob?  Clay?) that essentially half
of all players surpass their previous MLEs in their rookie seasons.  Maybe
more than half, since all of these players are young and improving.


Did they?  Offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th place
and last place, but no more.


Sure; they didn't have anyone better.  I suppose they might have gutted the
farm system to acquire Jay Bell or Spike Owen or somebody if they were really
in contention. 


If you'd read what I wrote, you'd be less amazed.  Nowhere do I claim to put
any credence in spring training.  Quite the contrary; I said that Lopez hadn't
done anything that even the bozos who *do* put credence in spring training
could interpret as ""failure"".  Just because I think spring training numbers
are meaningless doesn't mean that Bobby Cox does; it's just a case of ruling
out one possible explanation for sending Lopez down.

The problem is that there is no guarantee that this premium would be
lower for those who chose this type of contract.  Although you are
removing one service, that may have feedbacks into other types of covered
care which results in a net increase in actuarial costs.

The issue has never been whether tanks were used in Detroit in 1967.  It
has been whether they fired their main guns.  You did not merely claim that
tanks were used--you claimed that they fired their main guns to suppress
sniper fire and that they were ""quite"" effective at this.  You continue to

  Tonia Blanding, age 4.

  of the side of the apartment.""
  
       Well, it's not the main gun.  

""Well, it's not the main gun.""  Gee, that's only the entire point.  Are you
now going to admit that you were wrong?

  will I see any pictures of tanks firing their main
  guns?  Will I see pictures of buildings damaged by the shells?  Will I
read
  the reports of the tank fire?  I'll bet you dollar to doughnuts I won't. 
  It will take more than second-hand accounts from a few old National Guard
  sergeants shooting the shit to convince me that tanks shelled American
  cities in the Sixties.

Awesley replied:
    Well, if you bothered to read them, it wouldn't take long at all to
  find reports of tank * fire * -- although not necessarily of the main
  guns.

I will never read of tanks firing their main guns in Detroit in the '67
riots.  There is simply no way that such an event could have taken place
without it being common knowledge even 26 years later.  The American
military firing shells from tanks in American cities on blacks would have
been *big* news.

Awesley goes on:
  You can also read of the troops using grenade launchers.

To fire fragmentary grenades?  I doubt that as well.  To fire concussion
grenades?  Perhaps.  To fire tear gas?  Certainly.  But you would be
perfectly willing to let us believe they fired frags, wouldn't you, since
it makes your other claim seem more plausible.

And on:
  I don't
  expect to convince you; you'll have to open your mind and eyes and
actually
  do a little research to be convinced one way or the other.  Let me know

F-4s to launch rockets at buildings in Trenton, New Jersey would you

it?  Or would your bullshit filters kick in?

If tanks had fired their main guns in Detroit, people would have been

Well, looking at the videos it seems that this fire started in various
places at the same time, which would indicate that this was a planned
action. I'm sure FBI and BATF didn't *deliberately* start a possible

method. Looking at the careful operation, and use of tear gas
that as I know don't start fires, it is less likely that this 
was the case.

     I respond.

     The question that was raised was not if Jesus went to infernal Paradise
     before entering into heaven. No one has made a point for or against 
     that issue, nor have they compared the LDS position against orthodox
     belief. The infernal paradise is held to be Abraham's bosom (Luke 16), 
     the place of the righteous dead in sheol (equivalent to hades).

     The point that was raised by John was that someone could not repent
     on their death bed. Tom Albrecht pointed to a Biblical example that was
     contradictory to what John's position put forward. The thief on the 
     cross was promised by Christ to be with Him in Paradise, the abode of 
     the righteous dead. John's position possibly needs to be reworked.

I became aware of the claim years ago.  So I decided to check it out, on my
own.  But, then, that was in BN times (Before Net).  So, here are some 
references.  See Robin Lane Fox's _The unauthorized version_, (p.284) where 
Lane Fox writes, ""... the one passage which appears to [comment on Jesus' 
career] is agreed to be a Christian addition.""

In my Re:Albert Sabin response (C5u7sJ.391@sunfish.usd.edu) to Jim Lippard (21
April 93), I noted that consensus is typically indicated subtly as in Elaine 
Pagel's _The gnostic gospels_ (p.85), to wit:  ""A comment *attributed* to
Josephus reports ... [emphasis mine]"".  Scholars sometimes do not even mention
the two Josephus entries, another subtlety reflecting consensus.

So far as I can deduce, today's consensus is built on at least three things: 
1) the long passage is way out of context, 2) Origen did not know about the
long passage, and 3) the short and long passages are contradictory. 
I don't know the references wherein the arguments which led to consensus are
orginally developed (does anyone?).

Biblical scholars as I defined them include theologians and historians.  The
former, like the latter, incorporate historical, social, technological and
ideological contexts as well as theology.  So the distinction is blurred.  I 
didn't elaborate on that.  Sorry.  (In turn, historians are compelled to
incorporate theology).

Can't say about the number of copies.  These were, however, BG times (Before 
Gutenburg).  A hundred first editions seems exceedingly high; counting on one 
hand seems more reasonable.  Perhaps those mss. without the long insert (if any,
because anything is possible) have been destroyed.  Such a practice is 
certainly not foreign to religions.  Anyway, all we have are mss. which have 
the two entries.  Lippart (in the message noted above) talks about an Arabic 
ms.  But here the ms. date is critical.

"Forwarded from John Spencer (spencer@lowell.edu):

There will be two eclipses of Iapetus by Saturn and its
rings, in May and July.  Please spread the word!  Here's some
information about the events, and then a couple of messages from Jay
Goguen of JPL appealing for thermal observations of the eclipse to
learn more about the thermal properties of Iapetus.  He might also have
some money available...

John Spencer, 1993/04/21

Iapetus will be eclipsed by the shadows of Saturn's rings and Saturn
itself on 1993/05/01-02 (18:27-13:43 UT) and again on 1993/07/20-21,
(21:16-09:38 UT).  Timing is as follows;

     1993 May 1-2

        A-ring ingress  18:27
               egress   19:30
        B-ring ingress  19:51
               egress   21:42
        C-ring egress   23:00
        Saturn ingress  23:59
               egress   10:02
        B-ring ingress  10:28
               egress   12:19
        A-ring ingress  12:40
               egress   13:43

     1993 July 20-21

        Saturn ingress  21:16
               egress   05:08
        A-ring ingress  05:13  (grazing)
               egress   09:38

Times could be 30 minutes later according to an alternate ephemeris,
and photometric observations are important for refining Iapetus'
orbit.  Because the Sun's size projected on the rings as seen from
Iapetus is 3100 km it's unlikely that we will learn anything new about
the rings themselves from the observations.  See Soma (1992), Astronomy
and Astrophysics 265, L21-L24 for more details.  Thanks to Andy Odell
of Northern Arizona University for bringing the events to my
attention.

THERMAL OBSERVATIONS?


  To me, the interesting thing to do would be thermal IR of the 20 July
  disappearance into the shadow of the planet to measure thermal inertia,
  etc.  Unfortunately, the 21:30 UT of this event renders it inaccessible,
  except from Russia.  Even from Calar Alto, Saturn is rising through 3
  airmasses at 23:00 UT.  Do you know anyone in Russia or Ukraine with
  a big telescope and 10 um instrumentation that's looking for something
  to do?  I'd be willing to make a personal grant of >$100 for the data.

  Jay

and again:

  please try to encourage anyone that can observe the iapetus planet
  disappearance to do so at thermal wavelengths.  My impression would
  be that it's not an easy observation.  Iapetus will be faint and
  getting fainter in eclipse, so you'll need a big telescope that's a
  good IR telescope and reasonable 10 - 20 um instrumentation.  I don't
  think that combination is widely available at the longitudes that are
  well placed for observation.  We need SOFIA for this one.  One
  possibility would be the IR telescope in India, but it's only a 1.2 m.
