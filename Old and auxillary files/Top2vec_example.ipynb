      "\"It was a very easy decision to make,\" the 34-year-old told Norwich's website. \"The attraction for me was to continue to play in the Premiership.\" Canaries boss Nigel Worthington added: \"I'm delighted that Graham will be joining us until the end of the season. \"He's gives us a wealth of experience. Hopefully, he can be part of keeping us in the Premier League.\" Stuart has extensive top-flight experience with Everton, Chelsea and Charlton and can play across the midfield positions. He joins Norwich with the Norfolk club second-from-bottom in the Premiership, but Stuart is confident that the Carrow Road outfit have a bright future. \"I've been very impressed with the facilities here. It's obviously a very well run football club with excellent facilities and I've always enjoyed playing at Carrow Road,\" he added. \"It's a nice compact ground with a good atmosphere and hopefully I can help give the fans something else to cheer.\"\n",

      "Stuart, a former England Under-21 international, made 110 appearances for Chelsea, scoring 18 goals, before joining Everton. He won the FA Cup with the Toffees in 1995 and remains a hero at Goodison Park after his 81st-minute winner against Wimbledon saved Everton from relegation in 1994. Stuart spent just over four years at Goodison Park, making 125 senior appearances and scoring 25 goals, before signing for Sheffield United - where he scored 12 goals in 68 appearances. After signing for Charlton he made 164 appearances, scoring 23 times, but recently he has been battling a back problem and had not played for the Londoners for three months before heading to Norwich.\n",

But the hooker has proved his worth to the Zurich Premiership side and is likely to get a new deal next season.

Although he got match time with the Ospreys at the request of the Wales management, he admitted before his move to Gloucester that he was angry with the way he was treated. \"The WRU didn't give me any help off the field, it was very disappointing,\" Davies said at the time. \"It was a hard time throughout the summer, then deciding whether to accept an offer from Stade Francais which would have ended my Wales career.\"\n",

You do not become a bad team overnight. \"They have two world class game-breakers in Josh Lewsey and Jason Robinson, while Charlie Hodgson is just ready to click into place.\" He insisted Ireland will not make the mistake of being over-confident. \"That's not going to happen in our squad. No Ireland team lining up to play England will ever fall into that trap,\" he said. \"Every time we play England we know what a big task it is. Look at what they did to us two years ago. I remember that game all too well, and it was not a good feeling. \"I came on as a replacement and we were losing 13-6, and ended up getting hammered 42-6, so I know what can happen when England come to Dublin. \"They could so easily have been coming to Dublin with two wins and staring a Grand Slam in the face as well.\"\n",
